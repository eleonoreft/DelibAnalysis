## Motivation
DelibAnalysis is a tool that assigns democratic quality scores to any political speech - social media conversations, blogs, parliamentary speeches, etc. It is based on the Discourse Quality Index (DQI). It aspires to take a non-partisan, rooted in political theory, with the assumption that good deliberation is better for society. The tool was launched in June, 2018, and has been in increasing use across academia since.
