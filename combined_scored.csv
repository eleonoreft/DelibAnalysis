There was an old system but there was also a service delivery model that went along with it, to oversee and validate all the system operations. Your predecessor eliminated more than 500 Compensation Advisor positions.  That was the mistake, not the new system or the old system.  There was no verification, no thought to exceptions and special circumstances and no thought to quality service delivery because we're public servants, so who cares if the non-revenue-generating-overhead gets paid or not, right? His contempt for the public service was well known, but this is black and white proof.   Your first step in a sustainable solution is to reinstate the departmental (not centralized) compensation advisor function, THEN re-deploy an improved Phoenix.

To you and all of your distinguished academic colleagues at this great institution of higher learning in this country  _ Maire Clarke and members of the council, Chief Bobby Clarke of the FSNI and other chiefs that I recognize throughout the room, and metis leaders as well here this evening, thank you for your welcome, thank you all for coming tonight. Good evening to each and every one of you. I  »ll certainly be glad every time I have the opportunity to be back at the University of Saskatchewan, because it is my alma mater and over the years we  »ve been able to do some interesting projects together, and as Peter has mentioned just in this past year we have presided over projects that will invest in this institution something in excess of 150 million dollars to support learning and innovation and brain power in the University of Saskatchewan, in the Province of Saskatchewan and indeed all around the world. So our relationship is big and it  »s strong, and it  »s good to have this opportunity to kind of show it off to the Prime Minister, so this is always on his radar screen.We  »ve also been able to do some good work this past year working on some great many other projects working with the province of Saskatchewan for mental health and home care. There  »s 500 million dollars for infrastructure and for science. There are trade projects which expand the capacity for Saskatchewan producers of beef and pork and canola to export around the world. There  »s 54 million dollars more for affordable housing in this province. A very important 8.4 billion dollars nationally to invest in indigenous health and infrastructure and education to narrow the life gap between indigenous and non-indigenous Canadians. A big portion of that flows to Saskatchewan simply because of the demographics of this province. And most recently, some very important energy transmission projects that will benefit Saskatchewan in some 20,000 jobs that will be created in Western Canada and some 10 billion dollars in private sector investment.So, some good things have been done. There  »s a lot more to do of course, and in listening to you, the Canadian government learns better about what those things are. The whole world is living today through turbulent and consequential times. A time, an era in the history of the world that demands real leadership. Leadership that motivates and animates and energizes, leadership that engages, listens, accounts. And that is what this particular Prime Minister of Canada does so very well. In Forums like this one in every corner of the country - to listen and to account. In a direct, unfiltered and face-to-face fashion. And tonight, it  »s in the city of Saskatoon. So you  »re all welcome, thank you for coming, thank you for what you will contribute to this dialogue, ladies and gentlemen, Justin Trudeau.",1,3,3,2,0,0,2,0,1,0"Thank you thank you Saskatoon. Thank you Ralph for your warm words, thank you President for welcoming us here, thank you for the welcome on traditional Treaty 6 territory, it  »s a real pleasure to be here. Please, sit down, we  »re all friends here. I  »m really pleased here, this is a great turnout. This shows that - and there  »s an overflow room down the hall as well. It really shows that people are interested in engaging in the political process. In being part of coming out this evening and talking with the Prime Minister, asking questions, sharing some of the things that are important to you that you think about, figuring out where we are going as a country, talking about how we can each of us, as citizens, play a role in participating in building a better future for ourselves, for our kids, for our grandkids.  That  »s very much what I  »ve been doing over the last weeks over the country - I think this will be my 9th town hall, and it  »s been great. We  »ve had a huge range of questions on mental health - and of course we need to talk about that today because it  »s Let  »s Talk day, and if we haven  »t retweeted that and shared storied about struggles of mental health we need to, questions about veteran. I think we needed to have a day of experiencing what Toronto had to offer, they went to a couple of Raptors games and a rally jam-packed couple of days. I got to sit down with them and talk with them, including Jeremiah who asked me to give a shout out to this girl he knew Shay-lee, which is something that I was glad to do that night I had the town hall in London. A little reminder that kids are kids wherever they are. And regardless of the tragedies and the difficulties that people are facing we need to make sure that we are allowing kids to remain kids. And giving them the experiences and the hope and the opportunities that we need to have across the country. We have big challenges across this country on a broad range of issues. But one of the things that constantly reminds me of why we do this and encourages me to think that we are going to be able to work together successfully to build the best possible future for ourselves, our communities, our kids, is our capacity to roll up our sleeves and tackle these problems together. And that  »s why I  »m so pleased to be here tonight and to hear from all of you, and to chat with you on some of the issues you  »re facing, and mostly to keep working hard every day for you and for this country. So thank you very much for being here tonight and I  »m looking forward to getting to your questions. Yes. Let  »s start with a question from this section. Yes, you sir.",1,2,2,2,0,0,2,0,1,0"Good evening Mr. Prime Minister, thanks for coming. The question that I have for you actually it  »s related to the carbon tax policy. Of course, this being Saskatchewan I  »m sure you saw this coming. The question I have for you is what is the, what is the strategy behind choosing to pursue carbon tax, when there is ample evidence on the record in other jurisdictions showing that that policy hasn  »t worked. Why are we not pursuing a made in Canada strategy to combat climate change.",1,1,0,2,0,0,1,0,1,0"That  »s a great question. And it  »s an important one, because we know that one of the things we have to make sure we  »re doing is creating jobs, protecting jobs, building opportunities for Canadians to have good work today, tomorrow, in the years to come. And that  »s exactly why we  »ve chosen to move forward in a way that protects the economy and protects the environment. You talk about a made in Canada strategy, well the fact is, we have a made in Canada strategy. A strategy that draws on the tremendous success that British Columbia has had at pricing carbon, and making sure that putting a price on carbon polluters, their economy is more innovative and they get more solutions and are creating jobs of tomorrow. But more than that, what we  »ve managed to do coming together, creating a pan-Canadian framework on climate change that allows all provinces to do different things in different ways, to respond to their needs and their concerns, and will reduce our carbon emissions. And a part of that is recognizing the challenge of climate change, and part of that is also recognizing the opportunities that come with climate change. It  »s not a debate any more. Climate change is real. It  »s showing its impacts across the country, we know it  »s going to get worse. It  »s going to be more challenging. More floods, more droughts, more changes in weather patterns, more need to adapt, to mitigate the damage. So the question always is, how do we prepare for that. How do we make sure that yes we have good jobs today, but we  »re also bracing ourselves to manage the challenges come tomorrow, and take advantage of the opportunities that are coming with it. Putting a price on things that we don  »t want, like carbon pollution, is a way of encouraging people to innovate and figure out how to get around it. But I  »ve heard you. This transition period as we figure out a way to thrive on an economy that is less reliant on carbon is going to be tough on certain people. And that  »s why part of our proposal on pricing carbon pollution, the core of it is a promise that any money collected in Saskatchewan will stay in Saskatchewan. Anything anyone here pays in terms of a price on carbon pollution is money that the Premier, not the Federal Government will determine how to get back to the people who need it in Saskatchewan.  And what that will do, in terms of supporting people through this transition, is to make us think, because it encourages us to think about ways to pollute less, to innovate more. To think about where the jobs of tomorrow are going to come while doing it today. Now the previous government talked a big game about growing the economy. But they weren  »t able, for example, to create pipelines for example that are needed to develop, responsibly, our fossil fuels industry. And I say develop responsibly because we know we do have to figure out how to be less reliant on fossil fuels. But that  »s going to take significant amounts of time. And in the meantime, we have to make sure that the jobs, that the economies that are, right now, reliant on our fossil fuels  industry, get incentives to be better at using technology, to emit less, be more efficient, to become leaders at developing technologies that the world is going to need. And the way we do this, the way we decide that, you know what, we  »re going to put forward leadership on climate change, and meet our Paris Commitments, we  »re going to support people who need help with this transition, we  »re going to put a price on carbon, and doing that will allow us to do something that the previous government wasn  »t able to do, which is actually get pipelines like the Line 3 pipeline built. That  »s the balance we have. And that  »s what we have to try and manage. Now anytime you  »re going to make a decision, particularly around pipelines, you  »re going to have people unhappy with that decision. It  »s a big decision - there will be some people who will say   ìnope, you should have approved all pipelines  ù, there are other people who will say   ì no, no, no, you should approve no pipelines  ù and we did approve two. Looks like Keystone XL might be happening as well. So moving forward in a thoughtful, responsible way, that understands we do have to shift and grow our economies to adapt to the new reality of climate change, the challenges and the opportunities that come with it, in a way that doesn  »t hurt the most vulnerable, that protects the jobs we have today, that encourages people to think about the cleaner greener jobs that we know are going to come as we work on it tomorrow. It won  »t happen fast enough for some, it  »ll happen too fast for others. But I  »m confident that listening to Canadians, working with good people from coast to coast to coast, we  »ve got that balance right. Thank you very much for your question. A question from the back. You sir, in the glasses.",1,3,3,2,3,2,2,0,1,0"Thank you so much for this evening Mr. Prime Minister, I  »m an international student here from Iran, I was wondering if you could tell us about your future plans for resuming political ties with my country. As you may know the Canadian embassy in Tehran is closed now, and my friends and I we face many hardships to go to neighboring countries to apply for our Canadian visa, and also, our parents have to face these hardships to get a Canadian visa.",1,1,0,2,0,0,1,0,1,0"Thank you for the question. I think  _ and welcome here, and thank you for choosing to study here in Saskatchewan. Yes there are many different ways of looking at international relations and how Canada should engage with the world. But I  »m of the opinion that engaging in conversations, even with people you disagree with, is better than not talking to people you disagree with. Indeed, in diplomacy, it  »s more important to have conversations with people you disagree with than just conversations with people you agree with. However, we continue to have significant concerns with the Iranian government, which means we are cautiously reestablishing relations, in a way that doesn  »t ease off on the serious concerns we have about human rights internally, state sponsorship of terrorism, concern around the nuclear ambitions that have been expressed in the past, and carefully monitoring the agreement that was signed. Being thoughtful about how we engage, because right now anyone needing Canadian consular services in Iran has to go through Italy. And when we had the situation of Dr. Homobutfar from Concordia who was emprisoned in Iran for talking about, for doing research on feminism, for example, it was work that we did with the Italians, with the Swiss, and the Iranian government to try to get her home and we were successful in that. And part of that success was showing that we weren  »t unwilling to engage at all with the Iranian government, but that we were ready to talk with them about certain issues and certain files. But we do have to be very thoughtful, and responsible in how we approach, but one of the things that I always do is make a very clear distinction between the Iranian people and the Iranian government. I think that there are a lot of people in Iran who have questions and challenges around their governments and I think having engagement, diplomatically, to certain levels is ultimately good for them. Question, yes, you in the back.",1,3,3,2,3,2,1,0,1,0"Thank you so much for taking my question. My question is in regards to bill F-217, commonly known as Win  »s law. I  »m sure you  »re aware that unfortunately two years ago constable David Win was shot and killed at St. Albert. Since then, Michael Cooper has brought this bill forward to help change the law that states that currently,  the prosecutor or the police service may provide information on past criminal history currently that that person at the bail hearing is charged with. This bill has been passed unanimously twice in your House of Commons. And on the third reading, the Minister of Justice declined the bill. My question to you is, Mr. Prime Minister, is why have we not been given an explanation as to why the government would support this Minister of Justice in declining such an important bill that could improve the safety of Canadians. Not only just our police officers, but also the general public. Making this information mandatory to be presented to the Justice of the Peace or judge granting the bail, is quite important so why would we not make that mandatory? Any how can we ask these people granting bail to criminals, how can we ask them to make that choice without granting that information that is quite important for them to make a decision that is already in our law, that states that people are only granted law should they deserve it, and how can they make that choice if they are not presented with the right information. So could you please explain to me why we have not had explanation on why she would unilaterally to decline this bill after it  »s been unanimously passed twice. And, if I may ask, please, I  »m sorry, I  »m getting long winded, but could I also ask for you to reconsider your position on this bill because it is just such a small change that the government would make, just a word, that would have a significant difference in the safety of all Canadians.",1,3,3,2,3,2,1,0,1,0"First of all, thank you. Thank you for what is obviously a very important issue, to you and to a number of people. The fact is, you have me at a bit of a disadvantage, you obviously know a lot more detail about this particular piece of legislation than I do. I have an excellent cabinet, and an excellent Justice Minister who has my entire confidence and how understands how importance it is to keep Canadians safe, to protect Canadians, while upholding our charter or rights and freedoms. And that is something that we always have to work in balancing. We have to make sure that we know that what Canadian expect is to be kept safe and that their rights be protected. Getting that balance is sometimes a challenge, sometimes counterintuitive, I found myself defending the rights of a convicted terrorist to keep their Canadian citizenship on stage in the last election. In a debate. Think that something like that should be as black and white as:   ìif you  »re convicted of a terrorist offense against Canada, you should be stripped of your citizenship  ù. That seems like something that is obvious, that everyone should able to agree with. The problem, unfortunately, in that, is in the details. Because you can  »t actually strip any Canadian from their citizenship, you can only strip first or second generation Canadians, who have come here from somewhere else. And what that does is it creates two types of consequences, for people that are supposed to be equal. Canadians are not supposed to have different degrees of citizenship, whether they are born here, or whether they live here. But that  »s and example of something that seems to be obvious but that is actually more complex. So without going into the details on that particular piece of legislation, let me tell you, that we are constantly weighing the importance of protecting Canadians  » rights and keeping Canadians safe, particularly the men and women who serve in emergency services, as first responders and as police officers. And that  »s something that I will commit to you to take back to the Minister of Justice and ask her to explain more clearly to you and to Canadians the rationale behind that decision. Thank you very much. Sorry there are a lot of people with questions here and I am going to keep going through. You sir, standing there waiving at me. Yes.",1,3,2,2,3,2,1,0,1,0"Thank you Mr. Prime Minister, I  »d like to say that I was a man when your dad was Prime Minister. And I watched him do a lot of of, you know, fantastic things, and the one thing is related to First Nations Treaty Rights here in Saskatchewan. I come from treaty land, and I know we  »re celebrating 150 years of Canada this year, it  »s been 110 years since part of our treaty land was taken in 1907. I was told about that in 1973 when I was in grade 10, by one of my grandparents. He said we were going to settle it real soon. It wasn  »t until 1996 when I was working on the land claim, doing some research, that we finally got it. Still in 1999, I was the chief of the reserve, and I went and argued before your commission for the return of our lands from 1907. And they agreed with our argument, when we said that Canada owes us the land. They rethought the decision when they said that Canada doesn  »t owe us any land. Go to a second inquiry. The second one says that they don  »t owe us anything. But I think you do. In 1899, there was a Member of Parliament that said, that if it came down to the interests of the white people and the interests of the native people, the interests of the white people would prevail. So I  »m asking you, we don  »t have to go through anymore hearings, we  »ve had all the hearings, we  »ve had all the judges and the people looking at those things. And making decisions already. You can take it back to your parliament and right that historic wrong to Cowasis. That means that. And I  »ve heard you talk about young people, young first nations particular. I have many children, I have many many grandchildren. And from 1973 until 1996, the investments of those lands didn  »t go to that generation. We lost that generation. We have gangs here. And so, if you don  »t live up to the obligations and return the 1973 land to the Cowasis, we lose another generation. And so I  »m asking you, can you bring it back to parliament? And bring our land claim back to parliament?  And return those lands that belong to Cowasis by treaty. Thank you.",1,3,0,2,1,2,1,0,1,0"Thank you. Canada has not lived up to the spirit and intent of the original treaty relationships. We have failed to keep our word, the promise of shared stewardship of the land, of partnership, of support, of respect, of walking together, and we  »ve failed in so many different ways. Through residential schools, policies of assimilation, lack of trust and respect and partnership, and we have an awful lot to fix. But one of the things that I am so deeply encouraged by is that in the last election, and over the past years, non-indigenous Canadians have started to speak clearly that this is something that needs to happen. Indigenous Canadians have been clear that reconciliation is essential, and now you have a government that is committed to working side-by-side with you, with indigenous peoples across the country, to fix problems which, as you point out, in many cases go back hundreds of years. It  »s going to be a long process. There are complicated issues to sort out, there are fundamental injustices that continue that you can  »t just snap your fingers or slap down a pile of money trying to fix issues, like ensuring that young indigenous Canadians have the same equality of education, the same equality of opportunity, employment prospects as non-indigenous students, that health services, mental health services, addiction services be available for people right across the country.  That we can demonstrate the kind of infrastructure that will put an end to the boil-water advisories. Create better access to communication, to physical roads, that are all-weather roads that allow access to these communities. We have started in a significant way, on multiple fronts. We have invested real money - 8.4 billon dollars over 5 years in budget 2016, to start closing the gaps that exist in services and education and many things for indigenous Canadians. We have worked on accelerating the treaty resolution processes, on extending claims. And I know that the Minister of Indigenous Affairs Carolyn Bennett is working very hard on a broad range of them, including on your issue, sir. There is much to do, but I am every day encouraged by the level to which Canadians - indigenous and non-indigenous - are focussed on fixing past wrongs, mostly building a future of opportunity, respect and true partnership on this land that we share. So I will bring back your concerns and make sure that we are working on them. Thank you very much. Question from down here in the front now. You sir",1,3,3,2,3,2,2,0,1,0Mr Prime Minister thank you for coming to Saskatchewan,1,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,1,0"No, it  »s uh, no, it  »s right down here",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0"Thank you Prime Minister, my name is James Yiu. So a few days ago, Donald Trumps  » chief economic advisor stated that the renegotiation of Nafta shouldn  »t be a concern for Canada. The question, is Canada in a good position to renegotiate and also what does Canada want in return. Thank you.",1,1,2,2,3,2,1,0,1,0"Excellent question. Let  »s start with what Canadians expect of their Prime Minister in regards to working with the United States. I  »ve heard very very clearly in coffee shops across the country  in the past few weeks, and town halls, that Canadians want several things from their Prime Minister. They want our government to have a constructive working relationship with the new administration in the United States, it  »s going to allow us to work together on issues of shared economic interest, on the trade relationship and millions of jobs on both sides of the border depend on this relationship is part of it, and they expect us to stay true to the values and principles that make us proud to be Canadian. To understand that diversity is a source of strength. That openness to the world is a good thing. For our economy, for our jobs, and for our communities. That we don  »t have to compromise on security to welcome in Syrian refugees. So those two drives, of a constructive working relationship while staying true to our values, is what we are focussed on as a country. So over the past few weeks, we  »ve been, I  »ve had our embassador and senior officials engaging with the incoming administration, to do one thing first of all, which is to establish very very clearly, the level which the success of millions of American jobs depends on a smooth flow of goods and services across our border. Emphasizing the fact that 35 of the American states have Canada as their number 1 export partner. And that on a broad range of issues - from labor rights to environmental rights, to living wages and opportunities for people, Canada and the US are very well aligned. These conversations have gone well. But. These are negotiations, and we  »ll see where they take us. But there is no question that it is very clear that the success of the economies on both sides of our border depend on strong working relationships and smooth flow of goods back and forth. We  »re going to discuss and work with the new administration on a broad range of issues, and we will continue to defend Canadian jobs and Canadian principles. And that  »s what we want. What do we want? We don  »t just want prosperity for Canada. We want prosperity for North America and opportunity for people around the world. Because we know that prosperity an be shared, that good jobs created here at home, and opportunities around the world make the world a better place. So it is with that lens, that, absolutely, we want to help Mr. Trump ensure good jobs for Americans, and one of the best ways to do that is to work well with Canadians while ensuring good jobs with Canadians at the same time. That  »s the kind of approach that we  »re taking, any change in administration brings with it challenges and opportunities, and we are working very very hard to minimize the challenges and maximize the opportunities. Question from the very back. Back row, you standing up.",1,3,3,2,2,2,1,0,1,0"Can you hear me? So my question is about International Development. The lack of an international development institution, we are well behind the other G7 countries in budget for ODA, as a percent of the budget, and the ODA budget has flatlined in recent years. My question is, in 2017, will you predictably increase the budget in ODA, Overseas Development Assistance, sorry, and what else will you do to increase the role of Canada internationally.",1,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0"Great question. Thank you for your concern and your interest in how Canada can help around the world. A lot of people end up asking questions, look, we have real challenges we  »re facing here in Canada - marginalized vulnerable communities that need help, challenges around housing, challenges around addiction, challenges around a broad range of issues. Shouldn  »t we be focussing all of our efforts on helping Canadians before we turn around and help people around the world? And of course, we have to make sure we do what we can and everything we can to help Canadians. But we also have to know that the world has gotten to be a very small place. And things that happen overseas have direct impacts on us. One of the best ways to protect - not just Canadian security in a physical sense, but protect Canadian economic opportunities, security and stability, is by playing a positive role in the world. Helping kids in Sub-Saharan Africa have clean water and good schools. Helping rebuild parts of the world that have been devastated by floods and extreme weather events. Understanding that building capacity and opportunity for young people in far-off villages to access the Internet, education, to become participants in an increasingly knowledge based global economy, is ultimately going to be a guarantor of security, of opportunity for Canadians as well. So that  »s why Overseas Development Assistance is important. At the same time, we have to recognize that there have been billions upon billions upon billions of dollars, flowing from Western economies into the developing world, some has made an extremely positive difference, other investments haven  »t moved the dial very much. And we have to be very very thoughtful about the difference between giving someone fish and teaching someone to fish. We need to make sure that our investments are focused on empowering the most vulnerable in meaningful ways, which means doing more for women and girls in communities around the world. Creating opportunities for vulnerable and marginalized communities to become more successful, to become more empowered. We are going to be continuing to invest in predictable ways in Overseas Development Assistance, we  »re going to be smart about how we leverage private funds and convene nations to work together. And a great example of that is what we did with the Global Fund in the fall of 2016. Where Canada pulled together a broad array of nations, and raised close to 13 billion dollars to eradicate tuberculosis, malaria, and AIDS, by 2030. This is a global effort that Canada is playing a leadership role in. There  »s always going to be more needs and more need for more money. Canada is going to be part of the solution, but we  »re always going to be responsible in how we balance our engagement overseas and leveraging that as best we can, with the very real responsibilities we have with Canadians who are vulnerable, who need help through tough times here at home. There will never be enough money to do everything we want to do on all aspects, it  »s about choices, it  »s about priorities, it  »s about making our dollars go as far as we possibly can, and that  »s very much what we  »re focused on.",1,3,2,2,3,2,2,0,1,0"Hi there, hello Mr. Prime Minister. As an education student, I just want to know if you miss your classroom at all. Do you think that our current standardized education system is the best way for our students to learn, or are you planning on anything to change our current education system?",1,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,1,0"It  »s a very tempting question for a former teacher, I  »ll  tell you. But I will start by pointing out that I very much respect the Canadian constitution that says education is a provincial responsibility from K to 12. And the federal government needs to play a thoughtful and supportive role in that, and I certainly intend to.  It  »s up to the provinces to deliver education, but I certainly know that the way we look at education, the way we look at skills training, the way we look at secondary education needs to keep up with the times. We  »re in a rapidly evolving workplace, we  »re in a rapidly evolving world that is facing a broad range of new challenges.  And we have to give our citizens the tools to cope with that, and to thrive within a shifting situation. And that means training programs for people that are finding their industries transforming faster than they can adapt. We need to be able to give people new skills. Around technology, around computers, around new, innovative ways of working that  »s going to draw on our minds and our skills and our abilities. We need to make sure that young people in universities have access to top quality post-secondary education. Have access to being able to afford it, to being able to chose to go longer through education, which means, for example, what we  »ve done is guarantee  that you don  »t have to start paying back your student debts until you are making at least 25,000 USD a year. That  »s something that  »s going to make a significant difference in people choosing to follow through on their education. We  »ve changed from tax credits, which you pick up at the end of the year, to upfront grants that we  »ve increased by 50% for low income students, to be able to access the post-secondary education we need. And on the K to 12 area, we  »re working with the provinces to encourage teaching coding at a young age. So that young people can start to understand that regardless of their career, being powerful users of computers, of technology, being knowledgeable users of how to program algorithms, how to think, and help machines and computers do part of the work and the jobs that we  »re going to have - is going to be essential to our success as a country. So, I  »m a deep believer in education, but I know that education need to change to give more flexibility, more opportunity, more awareness to the world and the new challenges that are coming at us extremely quickly, and in an extremely challenging way. I have tremendous faiths in Canadians. And our ability to face-down and overcome the many obstacles w're facing. I also know that as a society, as a country, we need to be investing in giving people the tools they need to succeed -  education, training, developing new skills is going to be an essential part of that. And being innovative and creative in the way that we deliver those skills is going to be a hugely important part of that success. Thank you for your question. A question from down here now. You.",1,3,3,2,3,0,2,0,1,0"Good evening. My question is about the case processing center in central Alberta, I don  »t know if you  »re familiar, but it  »s moving to Edmonton. The community is quite concerned because 10% of the community is employed there. Can you speak a little bit to the reason why it was moved to Edmonton and if anything will be done to help the community to deal with that?",1,2,0,2,0,0,1,0,1,0"Yes. This is a decision that the immigration minister took based on evidence, based on the needs of our responsibilities of providing government services in a responsible way. There is no question that this is a difficult decision for the people that work at the center in Vagerville, which is why there was, I know, an offer that anyone that wanted to keep their job and do it in Edmonton would be able to, those who didn  »t would be offered a compensation, a package. But any time there are shifts like this, it can be very very difficult in a community. And I  »m sorry about that, I  »m aware of how difficult it is. I myself went through Vagerville a number of years ago while I was campaigning for the leadership, so I know what a strong community it is, and it  »s one of those decisions that one has to make in government that is a difficult one. We have a responsibility to deliver the programs and services Canadians expect, at a value level for the contributors who actually fund our government - our taxpayers. And making that balance right, making that work as best we can is what we  »re focussing on. But in this case I know how difficult it is for people in that community, I know we are also dedicated to help ease the transition in the community, and look for ways to minimize the very real impacts on the community. Thank you.",1,2,3,2,3,2,1,0,1,0"No no. Just one line on the one page is that no relationship is more important to me than in Canada than the one with indigenous peoples. That  »s part of a mandate that was given to all Ministers. And I think from our side, the Saskatoon Tribal Council, my question for you is that obviously you think this is an important relationship, but obviously Canada itself doesn  »t think it  »s an important relationship because it hasn  »t shown it yet. And I think that there is a disconnect between what you said, and how your administration, particularly Indigenous Affairs has taken that relationship. We see that disconnect in many ways, but a good example is the 8.4 billion that has been promised, not a lot has reached our communities yet. And especially in areas of education. And I know that people think, wrongly, that we  »re getting all this money. But we haven  »t seen anything yet and I think that that  »s where we want to make sure that people understand that. I know that you  »ve cultivated some relationships with the National Organizations and that  »s important. But those aren  »t Nations. And for us, the individual First Nations are the ones that are the treaty holders, they are the ones with the constitutional rights, and that  »s where yourself and your ministers need to be meeting with those. And we  »ve had meetings with ministers, they have lasted 5 minutes. And that  »s not a relationship. And my question to you is, as committed to this relationship, how are you going to fulfill this important relationship, and ensure deliverology.",1,3,0,2,3,2,1,0,1,0"Listen, you  »re absolutely right, that this relationship is of fundamental importance to me and to Canada. Making sure that we have true reconciliation, true partnership, with indigenous peoples is essential for how we move forward. And we know that the damages have been great over the past decades, generations and centuries, and there is much to do. But because of our actions, over the last year, there are about 2000 kids who started up the school year, in September, in a brand new school, across the country, in indigenous communities. 16 long-terms boil water advisories were ended, with a lot more going to be lifted in the coming years. And we  »re going to reach our target of ending boil water advisories across the country in 5 years. We have made significant strides forward on investing in indigenous education, 2.6 billion dollars.  And these are things that, yes, are not happening as fast as everyone would like. I  »m impatient as well on getting this done. But we also know we have to get it done right. In partnership. We have to build capacity. We have to make sure that we are truly empowering young people. We have to make sure that we are truly listening and giving weight to the elders. And to the young people, who have clear visions of how they want opportunities. You know I  »ve spoken to a number of chiefs who said, yeah we need a youth center. You want to talk to young people, we need a youth center in our community. Okay, well what would you want in that youth center? Well you know, we need TVs and lounges and sofas so they can hang around. And when a Chief says that to me I pretty much know they haven  »t talked to their young people. Because most of the young people I  »ve talked to are asking for a place to store their canoes and paddles so they can connect back out on the land, and a place with Internet access so they can do their homework in a meaningful way, because their homes are often too crowded and they need a place to work and study. We need to make sure we are listening to indigenous voices, because this is not just about throwing money at the problem. Although yes, we  »ve got a lot of investments going, it  »s also about demonstrating real progress on issues that have gone on far too long. And that  »s going to take new ways of approaching these challenges. It  »s going to take learning on both sides. On the government side, and on the indigenous side. As we figure out how to get this right. Because as we said, Canadians are here with us on this. They want - non-indigenous Canadians want to see us repair this relationship and move forward in shared prosperity and opportunity. This is a chance like we  »ve never had before. Where the good will on all sides is there. We have to do it right. This is a tremendous responsibility to yes, give the emergency supports and the mental health crisis supports we need right now for kids that are going through terrible, difficult times, for communities that are suffering and struggling right now. But we also have to be building for the long term. We also have to be preventing the cycles that have been set up because of the lost generations due to residential schools. We have to get this right, we have to do it together, and that means being thoughtful and responsible about how we move together. That  »s what Canadians expect, that  »s what indigenous peoples I  »ve met with expect, that  »s what I expect of our government. We will work together. We will change this, for the better, but it  »s going to take years, it  »s going to take decades in some cases. Before we have reversed centuries of mistreatment.

And knowing that there are folks out there praying for me is really important to me. This isn  »t always the easiest job. But I do know an awful lot of politicians, and every single one I know  truly believes, whether they are religious or not, believes that the calling of service, of trying to do right by your community, trying to build a better future, is one that we constantly have to rededicate ourselves to.

You know it shouldn  »t require any courage to stand up and ask a question like that, but I know that unfortunately still, these days it does. There  »s still a stigma around health issues, and too many people don  »t talk about them out loud. And I  »m incredibly proud today that I got to exchange a Tweet with Clara Hughes, who has demonstrated her courage and bravery in sharing her own struggles with mental health issues and sharing and inspiring Canadians to shift their approach. I  »m incredibly proud of my mom, who has been sharing her lifelong struggles with mental health. Which, when you think about it the statistics say one in five Canadians struggle with mental health issues, which means five in five Canadians know someone who struggles with mental health issues. Whether friends, or family, or co11lleagues, workmates. So we need to do a lot more about supporting resilient, supportive communities, addressing the fact that this issue has a massive cost on individuals, on families, on communities, and on jobs and our economy as well. Which is why one of the things that we  »ve done as a federal government is recognize the need for real action on mental health, and we  »ve committed a historic unprecedented 5 billion dollars on mental health specifically. And I  »m very proud to say that Saskatchewan, and Bradwall is one of the seven Premiers that have signed on to this approach in meaningful ways. This is something that we can agree on, that all Canadians know we have to move forward in thoughtful, responsible ways on. And one of the things that we are very interested and indeed excited about  is the fact that research has shown that for most people who have faced mental health challenges, some of their first occurrences, their first symptoms, happen when they are young people. So one of the goals that we have is to try to make sure that young people have much better access to mental health support. Timely, easy, free access to the kinds of support that they need when the go through difficult moments. This is a day when we need to talk about that. This is a day when we need to be understanding of how being strong, compassionate, resilient as a country is essential to our success, and is exactly what we intend to do in the coming years.

Additionally, we know it is easier to get donations from private individuals for tangible items or projects. In essence, if you have a short-term, definable project - you can get it funded by the public sector, the private sector or by individual philanthropists. But nobody wants to fund operational costs. Nobody will turn on your lights or pay non-contractual salaries. And what further compounds this problem is not only can you only fund short-term projects, they very often have to be brand new projects you have never tried before. If you've done a project before, they're somehow now considered part of your regular operations. This is a terrible model that causes not-for-profits to go back to the drawing table, year over year, to dream up new short-term projects because last year's perfectly viable program is un-fundable. The turnover rate of projects caused by this model necessitates extra staff time to a) dream up new projects, b) write brand new grant applications, c) train staff on the new project, d) work out the kinks of the new project. We know regulation of the not-for-profit sector is not going away, but they do deserve more recognition - by way of operational funds. Operational funds would additionally reduce staff turnover rates, making the not-for-profit sector more effective.Not-for-profits across Canada play essential roles in our communities and as our society as a whole. It's time for the government to reconsider how the not-for-profit sector is treated. Consider the possibility of matching funds - for every dollar given to a not-for-profit by the private sector or philanthropist for a short-term project, the government should donate a dollar towards operational funds or long-term projects.",1,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,0,0Why it took me 20 years to pay off my student loans !!!

Re: the 1st amendment, if it doesn t pass it means that we will follow the Constitution as it stands and will immediately be in a Leadership race leading up to October 2011, at which time there will be a Leadership Vote (One member, One vote). Furthermore, Leadership races do not have much incentive for Party unity since candidates are battling each other for the top position. As for the financial side, leadership races require much fundraising by the candidates which could possibly be in conflict with the Party s fundraising efforts. I could go on but I think you get the picture. Re: the 2nd amendment, it means that the Party may have to organize a Leadership Vote for October 2011 and a biennial convention for late Fall 2011. While possible, it will be a considerable amount of work in a short period of time.

Welwyn Wilton Katz",1,0,1,1,2,2,1,0,0,0"Hi Welwyn, I ll attempt to answer your question  if by Leadership you mean the Leader of the Party, Bob Rae, I cannot speak for him but he has stated that he wants the position to be more than a  summer job  and members seem to agree that rebuilding the Party will take a certain amount of time. The original reason for setting the current timeline goes back to the Chr_tien-Martin days when Jean Chr_tien announced his  eventual  resignation but took a good amount of time to actually do so. Hence the rule that the Leadership Vote must be held within 5 months after the Leader s announcement of or actual resignation (Constitution 54(2) & (3)(b)). On another note, we must not confuse the term convention  Since now we have one member, one vote for the  Leadership Vote , a convention refers strictly to the biennial convention or an extraordinary convention. As I mentioned earlier, delaying the biennial convention until January will provide us with more time to organize and may provide an incentive to members and donors that have maxed out their contributions to the Party since 2012 will be a new tax year.

I know it can t be our main focus, but we MUST ensure everyone knows that this sort of behaviour has consequences. Second, it s clear that the NDP has, from a policy perspective, merged with the Bloc Quebecois. How can we exploit this to pry the centre-left of the entire rest of the country away from them?

The grassroots and Riding activity is how you build and mainatain a Party.",1,1,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,1"Yes, I also agree the leadership convention should be postponed to give the Party ample time to regroup and rethink its policies. I am definitely not in favor of looking outside the party for a Leader. A case in point is what happened when we did _ ergo Michael Ignatieff. We have plenty of good men and women in the party, bright and capable but if we do look outside the party we should ensure that the person has political experience _ ergo Michael Igantieff. It is not necessary to merge with the NDP and why should we? Are the policies of the NDP policies those that we espouse? There is a huge vacuum that the Liberals can fill so lets be creative and find our own middle ground. We never had difficulty filling that void before this.We will find our own way, we will find issues that are dear to Canadians that are not being fulfilled. Lets keep in mind that 60% of Canadians did not vote for Stephen Harper, no matter what he says (delusional as he is) Within a very short time, Harper and Layton will give us ample issues to oppose. Theres no rush. The Conservatives/Reformers under the present leadership will soon step into another landmine _ and we must be ready to tackle these issues one at a time. And once we tackle them we must not let them drop as we did with the issue of the torture of Afghan detainees. Bob Rae will be a formidable interim leader. He has both the political experience and mental agility to deal with the dullards on the government side. Above all, lets remain united because we have not always been united. Lets think back not too long ago. The canabalization of Stephan Dion, by his own party was as disgraceful as Ive ever seen. This was a good and honest man and what was done to him by the press and the Harperites was bad enough _ but what was done to him by the Party itself was a shame that we will have to live with for a long time. I know of another Liberal who bastardized English and who went on to become one of the most successful leaders of our time. We all remember Jean Chretien.

Many believe that the contemporary Liberal Party has shifted to the right, as such, even grassroots members have been having trouble distinguishing the Liberals from the Conservatives. Let us not rush, let us exercise patience and consult more with the grassroots and retired leaders and Canadians in general, whom I believe still have a lot to offer this party.

This is a party with truly limitless potential for good in a young and underestimated country. Underestimated by ourselves, it s citizens. I believe and from where I sit I see us still shaking off the bindings of a long-defunct colonial power and it s remaining political infrastructure. We are a nation still healing from the damage done, where some continue suffering grave injustices rooted in unchallenged systemic discrimination. Our collective psyches have been affected by these experiences we share. But our party has been the one that fought for whatever equity we do enjoy and crafted the promise of amelioration of inequities. There is a tremendous amount of work to be done, politically, if we are to qualify for the inheritance of the LPC. It is a party with a history that is worth keeping close to our hearts. Going forward, human rights matter to all. Let s build on the past work of the party, in this regard. I agree this is 2011 and we are facing all kinds of beginnings and endings. I come from the food and water security grassroots part of the party. Responding to climate change is demanding we take action sooner than later. We need a food security strategic action plan based on our reality and a platform, ready to go, that literally zings with relevance to the Canadian people. If we delay our leadership race do we delay the building of this platform that will lead and guide the Liberal members who do have seats in the House? We do not want to miss out on the power of repetition. We need a platform that comes out strong in sound bites. For me the important question is how will delaying our leadership race affect our ability to respond to Canadians as the crisis of climate disruption increases and food sources decrease. What about climate change refugees in our own nation? Is is right to pretend that there will not be parts of the nation that are no longer livable? I think Canadians are wanting some rational political party voice to be brave enough, loud enough and stubborn enough (using the power of repetition) to address the gravity of our situation.

As has been stated above, the party needs time to redefine itself in respect to its position in the political landscape of Canada, now that we have the far right and soft right covered, all within the same party, and a centralist position with left leanings also covered with the NDP, whose mandate will have to be clarified in itself respecting the wishes of the numerous ridings that they took in Quebec to replace largely previous Bloc members, yet maintaining a traditional NDP position respecting a range of positions from central to a considerable distance left of centre. The Liberals need to define a traditional centralist role, yet one that will cover off right and left of centre a challenge indeed with the strong representation already doing this with the other parties. With the large youth population in Parliament now, accompanied with those younger people who are now taking an interest in politics, the Liberals need to focus on attracting this part of the population as well as the middle aged and the more senior, cutting across every nationality within our borders. We are so privileged to have such a diversified population in Canada with the wealth of cultures contributing to our mosaic. The Liberal Party must become the party of choice in a political world where they are going to be less visible than the other two mainstream parties.

I m referring to the period of 1957-63 when the Liberal Party ended in the situation very similar to the one we are facing today. It took six years for our party to return to power. We have to look back and identify how it was done. There are plenty of documents from this period. Good starting point for all of us would be the book by prof.

One common thread appears to be the want for the grassroots to rise up and have their say and in so doing lead the rebuilding of our great party. The trouble I am having with this entire  Special  process is the fact that we are so easily tossing around the articles of our constitution which is the Bible _ so to speak _ of our party. These articles in our constitution were written by grassroots members past and present. Some took years in the making. In fact, the 5 month rule only came after years of hardwork before it became a new article in 2009. Now, at the very first sign of trouble and at the first point in time that this new rule can be utilized, we are going to overide it for the sake of convenience. I m not entirely convinced that we can claim to be rebuilding a party of grassroots leadership when our first order of business in so doing is to trample on the very book that governs us. While I have the floor, I d like to know why the National Executive has not set out the rules and dates for the October 2011 Leadership Vote? Constitutionally, and in spite of this Special Convention, they were bound to set the date by no later than May 30, 2011. Is it arrogance? Is it assumed that the amendments will be passed on June 18 so the heck with following the constitution?

Moreover, I support the constitutional amendments that would delay a leadership convention and a biennial convention. I have been a loyal liberal supporter since I first voted in 1993 and on May 3, 2011 I joined the Liberal party of Canada because I want to help rebuild the party that gave so much to me when it governed. I believe the liberal party of Canada needs to rebuild the party from the bottom up. It needs to surround itself with fresh young faces and ideas. Its policies and platform that it will use to get elected and govern must be from the center with compassion, social justice and fiscal responsibility. The most important thing of all is that the Liberal party of Canada must listen to the Canadian people. Once this simple structure and change is established then a leader can be chosen. Regards Peter Papadakis (Laval les-iles, Qc.)",1,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"Hi, I intend to stand as a delegate for the upcoming Convention, and I d like to just detail a few of my thoughts here. Firstly, I m a young voter; this past election was the first I ve participated in (I m 20 this summer). As a young voter, I d like to share some insight with regard to how I perceived the election, specifically insofar as the LPC is concerned. My main issue here is that the Liberal Party seems, at the moment, to be not only unfocused, but concerned with seeking some sort of easy way to regain its traditional position as political heavyweight. Michael Ignatieff did a good job. He was not the problem with the recent Liberal showing. The silly accusations I read in the Star mere days after the election (by Liberal MPs, no less!) merely serve to validate the criticisms that other parties levied at us throughout the campaign, namely that we can t seem to agree on anything and that we re overcome by infighting. This detracts from any positive policy oriented message we can come out with. In short, the LPC was complacent this past election. We thought that now that Mr. Ignatieff was in the driver s seat, we wouldn t be plagued by the lame-duck accusations which so doomed Dion. Obviously, Dion wasn t the problem with the party, and neither was Ignatieff. The fundamental issue is a lack of coherent policy. It s not so much about being right, left, or center, but more about having some sort of focus or area of expertise which we concentrate the bulk of our efforts on. The Conservatives picked the economy, and the NDP picked idealistic revolution. What did the Liberals pick? We picked  not Conservative.  Be it health care, be it education, or be it the economy, the LPC needs to pick ONE, and only one, and make that the focus of its platform. That s not to say that we need to speak about only one thing, but something needs to be central. Something needs to be chosen around which all other positions can be anchored. In essence, we need a unity of policy. All that remains is to decide what it will be. I say we go on the basis of Constitutional/Parliamentary reform coupled with a brazenly socialistic approach to services. No dancing around the point or trickily naming things, but coming right out and saying that we intend to take Canada in a direction whereby the least privileged are the focal point of our concern, and wherein we do not pander to corporations or in-circles to win votes. The LPC needs to build for itself an image of integrity again. This isn t just about getting a new leader. It s about finding passion again.",1,3,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1"I have registered to be a delegate for the extraordinary convention. There are lots of insightful comments here, but I have a concern about the delay that I don t see addressed. In my opinion, Mr. Rae is a perfect choice as interim leader, but presuming that he will not be the actual leader after a leadership race has taken place, my concern is the  change of command . We don t know what the LPC plans are for this rebuilding and rebranding period. Will it be administrative (which is desperately required) or political or both? And what controls will be in place for the new leader to inherit? Will the new leader continue the interim leader s direction or will we be going off half-cocked again? The longer an interim leader is in place, the more the party will begin to take on his vision and this could cause problems. I am in favour of a delay, but not as long as some others have suggested. My two cents _ leave the politics alone for the first year (as much as possible). Get an organization in place that can issue tax receipts and membership cards, etc. in a timely fashion. Use the first year to streamline the basic administrative functions. Consider removing the commissions. Consider removing the Council of Presidents. Consider removing at least parts of the cumbersome provincial arms. The LPC is so fraught with red tape that this is part of the reason why volunteers on the ground are so frustrated.

This the the fourth election the Canadian people have rejected our policies. I would bet that many of us feel the same as me. It is certainly a time of reflection for the whole Liberal family. There are are some among us that are likely thinking along the same lines as me. Does the Party represent what I truly want Canada to be in the future or to put it a different light does the Party represent what Canada needs to be in the 21st century. One thing that has become very clear to me is that at this time Canadians do not want NEW national and costly programs. That in itself has struck at the very heart of why I am Liberal. I believe that the majority of Canadians still want a just, caring and properous society. At the same time they have rejected the Liberal way, we must therefore take the time to rebuild. Let Mr. Rae lead the Party for the next two years and that will give us the membership the time to pick the right leader to lead the Party.",1,2,2,1,2,2,0,0,0,1"Hi my name is Kerry Nelson and I work at the LPC s national office. It s great to see so many passionate Liberals posting comments about the proposed amendments. Many people have posted that they are standing as delegates. Thanks for stepping up! I am helping to organize the convention and I am happy to be here to help answer your questions. @Philip Chisholm: RE:  Who is in charge of the party?  Delegates at the Extraordinary Convention will determine how we move forward by voting for or against the proposed amendments. The decisions of these delegates will have an enormous impact on our organization. If the Constitutional amendment to delay the Leadership Vote does not pass, we will elect a new leader this October _ One Member, One Vote. For your question of  Does Bob Rae lead the party or Alfred Apps?  Of course they both have leadership roles, but neither of these individuals can override the decision of our delegates on June 18th. The National Board of Directors made the decision to propose these amendments to the delegates at the extraordinary convention based on feedback from our members. For Frequently Asked Questions, check out our FAQ page _ http://www.liberal.ca/faqs/ @Dale Partridge: RE: Harnessing your wonderful energy. Yes please! The best way to find meaningful involvement in your riding is to join your local riding executive. When I first joined the Party it took me a few years to realize that my local executive was where my political network would begin. Local ridings organize events, meetings, policy resolutions for the biennial convention ect. It can be frustrating to have so much wonderful energy and not know who to talk to. Here is the information for your local riding presidents: William Stewart is president of Nanaimo Alberni ab.stewart[at]shaw.ca and C.

We certainly should take time to gather our thoughts as Liberals and as a party on the direction and what our philosophy will be moving forward. It seems we have lost our way. I have spoken to many people before the election, during and since liberals and non-liberals. The one thing many people have mentioned is the Liberal Party is not like it once was. When talking to persons who were once liberal and seemed to move away from our party have in common is they believe the party has abandoned them. As a past candidate in provincial politics, it is my opinion we should begin by focusing on including young people as a key component to rebuilding our party along with considering the many other things we need to rebuild. That said, I agree with the delay and the amendments.",1,1,3,1,3,2,1,0,0,1"Hi, I can only be for the proposed amendment. We have, right now in the party, a need for stability and certainly not to tear us apart. But what I think is that the party have to find an issue in which it is clearly distinct than the other canadian parties. I think the major problem we had during the last electoral campaign is that the liberal party was too alike with the NDP, and altough I  m not opposed to many NDP ideas, I privilege the pragmatism that I see in the Liberal party. But being pragmatic doesn t mean doing nothing and surfing on whathever popular tendencies. We have to have something different to propose to Canadians. I don t know yet what, but I know we need that.",1,1,2,1,3,2,1,0,0,1"Bob Rae is not the answer although we are grateful to him for acting as an interim leader, but that is as far as he can take us. I agree that the leadership convention should be postponed since first of all we have not had any real leadership candidates emerge. I want a leader who can firstly win an election and be a credible possible Prime Minister. I think thbat during the next year to eighteen months some prospects will emerge. If we do it in October we will be stuck to choose between a group of  losers  who can neither raise the necessary funds to fuel an election campaign, nor can they create any excitement among the grassroots supporters. So many of us have been ignored for so long and it is time to change the party  brass  who have created this situation. I feel it is more important to rebuild the party from the bottom up and then choose a viable leader chosen by the party rather than by the M.P. s as was done in the recent past. If this once great party does not return to democracy and include all the membership we are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past.",1,2,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,1"Reading over the amendments (several times and I have read over many legal documents) I have no clue exactly what they mean _ and I would bet most members are confused also. I propose that any amendment be written in plain simple English (rather than lawyer speak) _ and that the proposed amendments are rejected until they are re-written in plain English understandable by all. Call it the clarity proposal is you so wish. And that this would apply to all new amendments. And to stir it up a bit a little brainstorming to get some creative discussions going   . I propose that the roles/hierarchy of all executive positions be discusses and evaluated so members can clearly understand what each position is responsible for and where they fit on the organization chart. And that an online forum, open to all party members, be set up to facilitate open discussion about the role/hierarchy of each executive position. In this discussion I would suggest that we also evaluate the structure of the party, and if needed, to re-design the overall structure of the party so it better reflects today s realities. I propose that the members of the party, in the next 2 to 3 months, examine and question carefully all party leaders/executives and decided if they are the right people to lead the party going forwards. And that an online forum, open to all party members, be set up to facilitate this examination. I propose that in the next 3 to 6 month all executive positions of the party (including the caucus leader, all presidents, all commission executives and any/all other executive position) be open to a vote (by all members of the party _ one person one vote) to decide who will occupy said positions. And that any member of the party can apply to these positions with no restrictions other than being a member of the party. And that an online forum, open to all party members, be set up to facilitate open discussion why the candidate is best suited for the position in question. I propose that all executive positions be reviewed yearly and voted on by all members of the party (online? _ one person one vote) to ensure that the positions are occupied by the best candidate. If confidence is lost in an executive then the position will be open to all members of the party and within 3 months a vote take place to fill that position. And that an online forum, open to all party members, be set up to facilitate open discussion why the new candidate is best suited for the position in question. Not sure if this is the way to proceed to rebuild the party but we must start somewhere and at the beginning the foundation is a good place to start I would think!",1,2,0,1,3,2,1,0,0,1"Hi Philip, Thanks for your comments! Firstly, I ll do my best to help clarify the resolutions  The 1st one says that the NBoD shall meet, as they are required to do as per section 54(3), on OR before October 1st, 2012. Then, in consultation with the Caucus and the Council of Presidents, the NBoD will set a date for the Leadership Vote between Nov. 1, 2012, and Feb 28, 2013. The Party will be given 5 months notice for the Leadership Vote (as required by the Constitution). The last line just says that this amendment shall no longer be of force or effect once the Leadership Vote hereby discussed has taken place or by February 28, 2013. In other words, it is a one-time resolution just for these specific circumstances. The 2nd resolution asks that the biennial convention take place January 13-15, 2012. It also states that this is a one-time resolution that will no longer be of force or effect once the biennial takes place. The governance issues that you bring up (structure & practices) will certainly be discussed as we will be rebuilding our Party. Just remember: all members who currently hold executive positions in the Party, whether on ridings, commissions, or PTAs, have been elected there by Party members. And these individuals are all volunteers. Also, there may be an issue amongst some members with the fact that Party members in BC get to vote on the executive for NB (for example). But these discussions will have to wait, first things first  for now and with this exercise, we need to know whether or not we are in a Leadership race or if we can initiate the discussions on rebuilding our Party (resolution 1). If the 1st resolution is rejected by members, then we are in fact immediately in a Leadership Race leading up to October 2011. If the 1st resolution is adopted, then the Leadership Vote will take place between the dates mentioned and we will be able to focus our efforts on rebuilding the Party. You seem to have many ideas and much energy to put in rebuilding our Party. That is terrific and just what we need! We will need to have open and honest discussions and debate and brainstorm many new ideas. For now, and from my perspective as an employee of your Party, the question is this: do you want us to focus our efforts in the next few months on organizing a Leadership Vote (rejecting resolution 1) or do you want us to focus our efforts on ensuring members  engagement and facilitating discussions between members to rebuild the Party (adopting resolution 1)? The choice is yours!",1,3,0,2,3,2,1,0,0,1"HI, I am a new member of the LPC. I volunteered to run a campaign office for our local candidate because I was so concerned about the way the Harper as PM had abused the democratic process. As an outsider I can concur that many feel that the Liberal Party does not seem to  have it s act together . For this reason I think that putting off the leadership decision is a mistake. Whoever is elected to lead the party will need as much time as possible to be in the media headlights. There will be as much dirt slung at him/her as the CPC can find and makeup. The longer the leader is in place, the better to counter such negativity. The LPC seems to have reacted in a knee-jerk fashion, 1st with replacing Dion and then with letting Ignatieff resign. The sooner we have a leader and we rally behind him/her we will be a contender in the next election. For those who commented that we should just wait and let the NDP & CPC make a mess, what if they don t? Harper was found in contempt, and that rolled off him like water on a duck s back.

Mr Apps has been with us since 2004 and really hasn t made much of an impression in our losses since then. He changed the rules, whether we like it or not, for the Coup D Etat to get Iggy in, surely must have been aware that that Iggy was a no starter and failed to read the feelings of thew membership and of the voters. As James has pointed out on my birthday, May 30th, I waited for Mr Apps s announcement for the October 2011 Leadership vote? In my opinion when the National President cannot or will not abide by the Constitution then he should tender his resignation or be turfed. Thats where we need to start re-building, not changing the constitution to fit each and every ones  personal agenda. We need some younger minds in our next quest, the rules and attitudes have changed from the old times and we must adapt quickly. Bob Rae is ok in the short run, but he has baggage and people remember well. So, he s a no starter to lead the party into th next election. Local committees also need to pick the best possible candidates, which may mean that the existing favourite of 20 years or so may not be the best candidate to put forward and of course we have to check out candidates BEFORE THEY ARE OFFICIALLY NOMINATED, to avoid any embarassment down the road, when it is found out the individual is not quite up to snuff or has a murky background. We need to win every by-election between now and the next general election to raise the total opposition numbers so that little Steve (put on weight again) doesn t get to comfortable in his role.

Even thinking about a leadership process without an honest discussion of why we were trounced by two other parties is a waste of time. I ve given our defeat some thought. We did not fail because Stephen Harper is a brilliant man who could out-think his adversaries; au contraire, being beaten by a weak contender like Harper is further proof that we didn t have what it takes to win and that we must determine why we failed. Two obvious reasons were that we were unwilling to confront important issues and apparently no one did a SWOT analysis. Here is a sample list of some of these issues: Michael Ignatieff did not look good on camera. Did no one in the Party Executive notice that: he had very crooked teeth/a bad smile; he looks too thin in shirtsleeves; he has a really bad haircut; etc. In politics an ounce of image is worth a pound of performance. Harper always looks like he has just had a make-over. He is overweight but his team manages to make him look him less so. Michael Ignatieff is not Martin Luther King: calling out  rise up, rise up, rise up , etc. to a crowd doesn t work for him. It was reminiscent of Howard Dean; i.e., too strange for people to relate to. Michael Ignatieff didn t address the Reform Party s attack ads; e.g., most normal people would take a prestigious job in another country if they could. It would have been easy to say, for example, that the only reason Harper didn t take a job at Harvard is that (a) he wasn t qualified, and (b) no one offered him one. Harper s lack of loyalty to Canada was amply demonstrated by his treasonous Alberta Firewall letter, which was never even mentioned by Liberals. An election is like a sale. The First Rule of Sales is  if they don t like you they won t buy from you . Most people didn t like Michael Ignatieff, even if they believed that he had a superior intellect. They could not relate to him on any level. He should have learned to like Tim Horton s coffee, etc. well before the election. Anyone who has watched the Royal Canadian Air Farce would know how important this is. Harper had many weaknesses (he is an  economist  who doesn t understand economic basics, for starters) but the Liberals failed to exploit them. Michael Ignatieff has poor judgment; e.g., interrupting a hockey game. I m afraid that there is no cure for this but experienced advisors should have revented such a gaffe. Michael s wife had six years to get Canadian citizenship, which made him a laughing stock during the campaign, as in  even his wife can t vote for him . Totally avoidable and a gift to Harper. The Liberals failed to have a concise, focused, and clear message that they could repeat consistently during the campaign. Long, rambling discussions don t result in votes. The Liberals never asked themselves the most important question:  What do we have to do to win? . The election resulted in a bi-modal distribution with the Liberals occupying the valley in the middle. The best solution may be for the Left to unite, as the Right did under Harper. Unfortunately the terms of a unification would now be dictated by Layton. It doesn t look good to me. A defeat in the next election will probably be the end of the Federal Liberal Party as a political force in Canada. And finally, does anyone in the party executive honestly believe that if Jean Chretien had been our leader that he would have lost this election to Stephen Harper?

I don t know if I was delusional at the time or if this Liberal bickering is a new phenomenon. I m interested to see that a number of people are suggesting we focus on one issue. I would disagree. I would like to suggest that we come up with a clearly-articulated vision of what we would like Canada to be and then design policies to help us attain that vision. As you can imagine, I was never a fan of Mr. Trudeau (possibly jealous of his charisma) but he did articulate a vision. It seems to me that we have become a country of pessimists and that should stop. One of the newspaper columnists here in Toronto made the comment recently that Mr. Harper sets the bar low so that he will not be forced to break promises. This is sad. If we don t set the bar high, what do we have to strive for? I do think Mr. Ignatieff was badly advised during the election. People seemed to be trying to turn him into something he is not.

I will be happy to support the two amendments if the following conditions are understood: we must use this opportunity profitably and with a purpose to re-form and revitalize the Liberal Party, so that we can come to the next election saying with confidence,  Look at us now, Canada!  Included in this would be to: -develop our use of social media to increase membership, improve fundraising, attract young voters, and improve communication among Party members; -bring the Party constitution and mission statement up to date; -identify and develop the participation of Liberal candidates to run in the next election; -and identify and develop candidates for the position of Party Leader, to be chosen during the Leadership Convention in January, 2012. 2. I feel that the most desirable attributes to look for in a leadership candidate include the following: -a strongly developed sense of patriotism is vital; -a strong character who can retain his/her composure and work effectively in an extremely challenging, sometimes negative, work environment is also essential. Also required are: -a basic selflessness of personality; -an ability to envision and articulate short and long-term goals, both for the Party and for the country; -the possession of an intelligence that can see things from many perspectives, and make good choices (to  think outside the box  and act effectively); -the ability to consider counsel from many sources, sort the best from the rest, and to make the best decision. 3. We might also wish to consider whether it is in the Party s or the Canada s best interest for us to  un-split  the left vote, that is, to merge with the NDP, if they wish to, as the right did (Conservatives/Progressive Conservatives/Reform Parties) in the early 2000s. Whatever paths the Party decides to take, after this hiatus we must come back to the Parliamentary table a fully functioning, active party with clear goals and directions. We must all work together to achieve these goals. Jennifer Cawthorne Scarborough, ON.",1,3,0,1,3,2,1,0,0,1"Let s reframe the debate around the kind of country we want to live in and contrast it with the way things are working now. Job creation is our number one priority and there are unrecoverable opportunity costs in making the wrong investments. Invest in the people. Let me first premise my discussion by reflecting on the financial meltdown. The lessons of the free market meltdown appear to be lost. I hope that all may see the wisdom in a balanced approach to the marketplace (i.e. a more equitable split of public and private services and an enhanced regulatory regime). The costs in health care have an emphasis that is wrongly placed on treating the symptoms vs. preventing the cause of the illness. The question of sustainability of rising health care costs is the wrong argument. If you change the paradigm, however, it changes the nature of the problem. We are facing a pandemic of cancers and toxic reactions because of our environment, nutrition and life styles. The first step is to stop the cause _ comprehensive environmental and consumer protections. Regulation and control, storage, secure transport and disposal of toxic substances should be a priority. James Cameron s recent point on the oil sands was a coherent one. Don t develop beyond your technical ability to deal with the polluting activity. The one value most s share is there connection to the land. It is our shared heritage and responsibility to keep our land and its waters as clean, pristine and safe as we can. I don t believe any level of governance should sign any trade agreements that don t have rigorous consumer and environmental protection clauses written into them. Government has a moral obligation to protect the land and well being of its citizens. The statistics on the health effects and lost time due to stress, poor nutrition, food and drink born illnesses reflect the need to institute comprehensive inspections and warning systems for the food chain. From my perspective, private pharmacology is the wrong business model for social medicine. There is a role for establishing crown corporations based on sound business practices generating monies for government coffers. By establishing a national public drug program and being wise stewards of our intellectual property rights, we could patent discoveries resulting from publicly funded research and development in health care and market these abroad filling government coffers instead of emptying them. This will quickly evolve into high quality, high paying jobs. We could start to accomplish this by: Revision of patent protection legislation for pharmaceuticals Gradually increased production and use of publicly produced/provided medications Increased research and development in training hospitals, public health research facilities and in post secondary institutions Increased studies and programs to establish best practices in patient outcomes A national mental health strategy (The plight of those suffering mental illness in Canada is a national disgrace) Awareness and promotion of physical fitness and mental health Reduction in work week hours More supports for workers: stress reduction strategies for the workplace flexible work arrangements shorter work week _ reduce the work week to 32 hours and drop the unemployment rate to create a more equitable, rational, relaxed society Strong, comprehensive pension support including small business and independent workers How proud our children would be if we were to establish bona fides with third world nations by exporting free medications and training as part of comprehensive aid packages. That reflects what I believe is another shared value; compassion for others and offering help where and when it s needed. Finally, let me conclude by stating that the system is disjointed with no economies of scale and bereft of very much compassion. Waiting lists are the  new normal . There are savings in having a modern integrated, health care system. The first principle of this modern system of health care should be client empowerment. That would encompass currently outlying services dentistry, physiotherapy, massage, chiropractic care among them. This new system would be innovative exploring alternative therapies and include the following: Expanded health/patient care investment in mental illness. Greatly increase the number of seats for doctors, nurses, scientists, engineers in Canada Reduce the training costs _ ensure we are training our own young people for these jobs _ a very good place to waste billions  Comprehensive db of the benefits/side effects of all treatments especially drugs Accessible, secure electronic patient health records Together, let s what our future state should be. Articulate the changes necessary to bridge the gap and implement the new system. The money is there _ through revenue generation, existing funding and future efficiencies. By acting now in the interests of what is the best thing for the nation, we can train our young people for the knowledge management jobs of the future and enhance our global position as a world leader.

I find that before we can have either convention it is very important for the Liberal party to rediscover itself.

There are two main issues we have to address: (1) as important as social media, membership and grassroot work are, we will not be effective if we do not know what we stand for. (2) The recent elections have shown that Canadians find us lukewarm and unappealing. The next few years will be the opportunity to have important, yet hard conversations (such as those on health care, immigration, foreign policy, energy and resources). Are we ready to lead when it comes to those conversations? Or do we simply formulate answers that please Canadians? I believe in the Liberal party that stands for its convictions and fights for Canadians. And this does not mean fighting among ourselves. All the in-fighting must stop. We cannot rebuild out party, or our country if we continue this way. We need unity of minds and hearts. We all love Canada, let that love and out vision for our country unite us and move us forward.

I had suggested earlier that we should present to Canadians a clearly expressed vision for Canada and then design policies to help us attain that vision. I would suggest that these policies be designed in part by groups of Party members (and perhaps even non-aligned citizens, from all across the country. We are a huge country with different problems and issues in each part. If we are to do what is best for the entire country as opposed to what would work best for any single riding or region, then it is imperative that we understand one another s concerns. In this day and age of Skype, webcasting, etc. surely it would not be too difficult to set up these groups. I would like to see a sitting MP be part of each group. This person would be there to explain the political process to us so that we could understand the difficulties of governing. Apart from that, he or she would be one among equals. These groups would be made up of people of different age groups. Having become a Young Conservative at the age of 16, I understand the importance of having young men and women involved in the political process. Now that I am coming closer and closer to being 70, I also think it is important that people in my age group be heard from, but also have the opportunity to hear what the young people are thinking.

Because the executive alone established the conditions for selecting an interim leader. Members were not engaged in that decision. Why not? If the Party is to be truly democratic, members must be allowed to debate and decide on eligibility criteria for candidates for permanent leader. That includes reviewing the conditions that exclude the interim leader from being able to run.

The first communication that I had outside the Thank You for joining the Liberal party e-mail was a telephone call for more money. While I realize that fund raising is important, I felt that at least my riding association would have contacted me before the request of money. Felt like I was just a cheque book. If we need to expand the grass roots support, I fell that the first contact after joining should not be a request for more money. Get people involved, develop relationships, and then ask for money. By the way I did donate. Regarding the extraordinary convention, after receiving the reminder e-mail about nominating yourself to attend I decided to do so, just to get involved and meet the rest of my riding association when delegates to the convention would be selected. After all who would really vote for a member who has just joined the party. Imagine my surprise when I received an e-mail today saying that I have been acclaimed as a delegate to the convention.

I know the party is despondent, but not being even able to generate enough interest in the convention to require a voting process does not bode well for my riding. So taking vacation to attend I am looking forward to meeting everyone at the convention. Regards C.J. Harrison Oak Rides Markham",1,1,1,0,0,,1,0,0,1"First, I want to commend the Liberal Party for opening up the comments section so members are free to discuss their opinions with others. I m a firm believer that the rebuild starts with the first conversation, so this is a great start. I encourage the Party to continue this practice after the Extraordinary Convention, and open the website up as a forum for members (and the public) to have frank and open discussions. I m very happy to be a delegate at the upcoming convention _ I believe it is important for the party to push back the timing of the potential leadership convention and biennial convention and I will vote accordingly on the 18th. The Liberal Party has been through what I would call a traumatic experience and it needs some time to engage with members and re-evaluate how to move forward. This is new territory for everyone and we have to figure out the way forward, but in a logical, efficient (and, I might add, cost effective) way. The Grassroots of the party are very important in this process and I am heartened by what I hear from the members who have commented. So continue the conversation _ I look forward to helping rebuild the party with all of you.

We gravitate incessantly towards an ideal that we never reach. No sooner have we reached the point we are aiming at, that we discover new horizons whose existence we never even suspected. We dash towards them, and those new horizons, explored in their turn; we discover others to which we are carried away, on and on, further always. Thus will it be as long as man is what he is; as long as a soul immortal sits in a mortal body; his desires will always spread wider than his means, his actions will never reach the level of his conceptions.  Wilfrid Laurier, 1877 I would contrast this vision of what Liberalism meant to one of the leading names in our party to the current state of affairs within the Liberal Party. There has never been a time with easier means of communicating amongst ourselves then there exists today, but instead of a greater dialog and debate we are slowly breaking apart due to lack of shared goals. May 2nd was a watershed event for our party. From the postings here we can see many new voices are joining to help rebuild the party. We need to stop seeing these new members as just sources for donations and encourage their participation in debating our future. We need to come together as a party and for that we need extra time before adding the stress of another leadership race. For that reason I support the proposed constitutional amendment. For new members looking to help rebuild the party, welcome! If you would like to help rebuild you may want to start with your Electoral District Associations. Volunteer to participate on the policy and membership committees. Set the tone you want to hear to fellow members.",1,3,3,2,0,0,1,0,0,1"Thanks for this forum. My understanding is that we re a grassroots party. Key to grassroots is communication _ transparency _ party cohesion. There s one broken communication link that I m aware of. I was webmaster for our riding during the election, but after May 2 communication with our members broke down. We d been talking to them regularly during the election using the websites and blast emails, so the opportunity was ripe to invite them to join in renewal of the party. Our candidate had just lost the election. The whole party had lost big. What were we supposed to say to them? I think it was critical to say SOMETHING to prevent members from drifting away. But we sure could have used some party guidance on the WHAT of the message. When I m representing the party in a message, I want to make sure I m getting it right. Our leaders seemed to be talking to the press and each other, but the silence from within the party to the EDA s was deafening. If EDA s are valued, if members are valued, we have to open up the lines of communication and start talking to them, especially when it matters.",1,1,3,2,0,1,2,0,0,1"I believe the party needs to consistently listen to the grassroots. Denial of such is at their peril. I believe that we need more time than the next few months to select a leader. I for one will be supporting a deferal. I have been involved in leadership races in the past, and people carry a lot of baggage around for years, myself included. Now is the time for some healing, listening, and consultation.

Kids who are carrying signs for candidates _ kicking them down the street, candidates at their  open houses  who didn t network or speak with others, and in my neighbourhood, signs didn t go up until the day before the election. Like many of the individuals who have posted, I mostly got phone calls for money. It isn t just about that is it? it s about energizing the masses, about engaging with every Canadian and showing/sharing values. All missing in the way the campaign was conducted. Since the election, not even a call from the local office to say  hey thanks for coming out , or an email from the Women s commission to say  ok, this is what we re going to do now   or   Do you have any ideas    This forum is a great idea, but the grassroots, local, personal touch is really missing.",1,2,2,1,0,1,2,0,0,1"Thank you for this great initiative and your quick response to questions being raised. Well done! I m very supportive of the steps that have been taken by the National Executive to provide members the option of delaying the leadership vote in this circumstance.I will be standing as a delegate and will support moving the date beyong the current October date.

This forum is a good example of that. The party needs to be respectful of the interest and willingness to contribute to these forums, if the grassroots epithet is to be believed. Member forums are worth far more than donations (at least if Obama s campaign was any indication). Involved members tend to donate money as well as time, but only if they know their involvement is appreciated and incorporated. When I first heard about E-F, I got involved in the discussions by inputting 40 letters. It was great fun. So many thoughtful, constructive conversations on there _ very worthwhile Then the party sent me an email saying: Send us your best idea for Liberal party policy and you may win a space at the Montreal Convention. I thought, what s wrong with this picture? Don t they know about En Famille? But I did send them my best idea, namely, please check out the 40 letters I ve already written on En Famille. Those are my best ideas. As far as I can make out, the internal leaders of the party don t value En Famille, even though the members have contributed hugely to it. And there s a very clear, albeit unspoken message in that. Are we grassroots or not?",1,2,3,1,1,1,1,0,0,1"Policy schmolicy. We went into the election with sound, supportable, policies, and great candidates, some of whom were defeated. Mike Savage, Dartmouth, was defeated by an NDP who doesn t live in the riding, and has been out of politics forever. The NDP had unsuppotable policies, and have shown the people of Nova Scotia they can t be trusted, provincially _ but nonetheless, the NDP  tide  swept through the urban area. In my opinion, it had nothing to do with policy, and everything to do with the conservative attack ads. Those had the effect of driving the voters away from a good party with a great leader,although didn t achieve the goal of driving voters to Harper, but rather to the other slightly left party. Unfortunately, voters don t really pay attention to policy, they pay attention to image.Nor do they pay attention to quality. Unfortunately, the Ignatieff image was not good. But I saw him in person in Halifax, for the first time, and he was phenomenal, brilliant, great on his feet, etc. Even the media came around, and was very complimentary. But our next leader must be charismatic. Brilliance and competence are not enough It is therefore only by chance that we occasionally achieve great leadership in Canada. But the other painful problem for our party, is that we continue to be plagued by what one radio journalist described as the Liberal  Tribes .If we don t stand behind our own leader, who will? Yet, here in NS, we still have for example,  Martin Liberals, Turner Liberals,Chretien Liberals, Cowan Liberals, McLean Liberals,Savage Liberals, MacNeil Liberals, Whelan Liberals.In so many conventions, I have supported the losing candidate, but happily put on my red hat, and happily and honestly stand behind the successful candidate . I will always continue to do so. And we all must, otherwise the fractures in the party will destroy us. Jean McKenna",1,1,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,1"The Trudeau years were this parties glory years, and the further the party got from the principles of that era, the more our support erroded. We need to listen to the party elders as they do in our aboriginal communities and understand where we have come from. Canadians are looking for a true made in Canada government, and the best example of that in my lifetime, (although I was a member of the Conservative party at the time), was that of Pierre Trudeau. We need to get the train back on the rails, we need to be unified in our unwavering vision of what Canada should be, and then we need to have a vision statement that reflects our vision for this country, and follow it.",1,1,3,2,0,1,1,0,0,1"Thank you for opening up the forum for input from members across the country. It is a valuable process and one that needs to be done. As a communications individual, the Liberal party of Canada has to immediately stop two  branding  issues as they play into the hands of the Conservatives and the NDP, namely victimization and entitlement. First, the party/MP s need to stop using  bullies  in their questions, scrums, interviews, panels, etc  This is a message that will draw comparisons and contrasts that will ultimately benefit the Conservatives. When someone calls the other a bully, it inevitably makes people go support the bully as they are more likely to  protect  and  be cool.  Now, the reality is, that is completely laughable to imagine the likes of Van Loan, Harper, Clement and Baird walking around the school yard when they were teenagers beating up kids to get a smoke. It is more likely they were picked. However, when the term  bully  is used, it is helping their  brand  with leadership, strength, and direction, even if we do not like a bully. As much as I like Ignatieff, our communications strategies with  bully  forced a contrast position that Ignatieff was the  wimp  and built the  bully  leader brand of Harper. A new leader should not be engaging in that messaging, but that it should be carried out by the key spokespeople of the party. And, if Harper s minions throw a punch, don t be afraid to throw one back using the key messaging. A strategy has to be implemented that doesn t use shrill tactics, but sharp, consistent messaging over a period of four years that will shake the  leadership  brand around Harper. Remember, the key talking points for Harper s ministers and MP s throughout the first two years was  under the strong leadership of Stephen Harper  and the use of key words like,  principled.  We cannot continue to laugh at this strategy because it works. Second, the Liberal party has to immediately stop believing that it is the natural governing party, or that it will return to power once the Harper Tories fail. This will guarantee the party will never return in the near future. What is the reason why we should return to power? We are not entitled to government. We have to make the case why, and we have to argue it on the street level. For instance, in reference to crime bill why are we not arguing the cost to the taxpayer. For instance, it costs the taxpayer $192 per day to house a non-violent prisoner in a facility with no capacity to provide rehabilitation and therefore more likely to recommit a crime. However, it cost the taxpayers $101 per day to house a non-violent offender in a transitional home where they can work and rebuild skills and are less likely to recommit a crime and thereby burdening the taxpayer. Or better yet, if my kid gets caught with a pot plant, they could face six months in jail. This would cost $192X180 days = $34,000 for one kid. Why not put that money towards prevention thereby bringing down the cost of crime. The message should be,  that s an expensive lesson for the taxpayer for something so minor.  Incarcerating minor offenses increases the burden on the taxpayer not lowering it. A new leader should not argue it is the  right  thing to do, as this comes back to the  entitlement  brand .Liberals do not have a monopoly on morality. It is not the right thing to do in Canadian s minds because we have not attached a dollar figure to it. It is the reality of today. A new leader should know the cost of a loaf of bread, love hockey, bring their kids to a football, baseball or hockey game and identifies with the bread and butter issues are of the day. Own the narrative don t follow it!",1,2,2,1,0,1,1,0,0,1"Others here have probably already said this, but this forum seems rather redundant, given that we already had an a-one forum at En Famille which was seriously neglected by the party brass. In fact, many folks here don t seem to even be aware of  En Famille . I can only hope that our new leadership and the rebuilding process will take these discussion forums seriously. There were some brilliant ideas and suggestions posted at En Famille when people were actually using it, and it languished for lack of attention by the  powers that be . I m trying desperately to be optimistic and am still maintaining my position on the executive of my riding association, but have already ceased one aspect of my involvement (our website management) because of interference and the  Father Knows Best  attitude from National. Don t get me wrong  I understand how difficult the management of an organization like this is, and I know that change can t happen overnight.

By doing so, this could establish the direction towards an area most Canadians want to see, rather than the weary back and forth exchange of power between the Conservative and Liberal parties hat had taken place in the past. The NDP opportunistically took advantage of this, here in Quebec. As a Montreal West Islander I am in a worst of all worlds situation. From a municipal perspective I am despised by the Montreal main island (the Montreal Metro system runs East, North and South, but curiously the Montreal Transit Corporation compass does not include West), as a Provincial Liberal we are well served by our MNA but taken for granted by the party , as a Liberal riding we are part of the enemy as far as the current Federal government is concerned. If on the other hand I was in Tony Clements  riding, I would have benefitted from Multiple projects worth millions of dollars under the guise of the G8 summit. Politicians, no matter at what level they represent, should be acting on the best behalf of all citizens. Looking backwards does no good as this boils down to an exercise in who fired the first shot in the Middle East conflict. The systems we have in place are not working and as a Net-Net result Canada will slip behind developing countries. As the economies of China, India, etc as well as the number of their middle class, increase, we will find ourselves facing stiffer competition for products. As we sell off our corporations we ll be potentially faced with shortages of oil, electricity, pharmaceutical products, even food, as production here could be sold at higher profits, out of country.

Or build a passenger train network serving most of the country. Or roads to the north. Or ports in the Arctic with ships to match. Or domed cities in the north where people can live more normal lives. Such ideas are only examples, but they would easily replace $100 billion dollar im ported stealth fighter planes.

One thing I noticed was poor advertising of Liberal Ideas and a poor platform that did not meet the expectations of Canadians. We need to address concerns such as: 1) Economy (promoting Canadian Industry and promote small business creation by either creating an agency to help get those that wish to start their own business and or by helping with grants.) 2) Trade (both internal and international) 3) Human rights (Labour Rights, minorities, women) 4) Military (why for example are we buying and leasing equipment from other countries, doesn t Canada have a strong industrial base so we can make our own military equipment?) 5) Promote Cooperation (and funding) with the levels of government (provincial and municipal) to create more affective economic, educational, environmental and health care plans. 6) Oversight as to why the cost of living is increasing, why gas/energy prices are jumping all over the place. The Government may need to take on a more active role in oversight and regulation. Yes we all understand that businesses need to make a profit, but there must be a difference between profit and simple greed and selfishness. 7) Job Creation/Debt assistance programs for students that are either still in school or just coming out of school. 8) Military recruitment programs: - change the physical requirements to meet more specific elements, for example the physical requirements of an infantry-soldier shouldn t be the same as a cargo plane pilot. Sure it makes things easier, but I feel the requirements should reflect the area the recruit wishes to enter. Also have a general physical requirement, then break it down to meet the requirements of specific elements of the military. (Army, Air Force, Navy.) - Pay bonuses, for technicians, engineers, pilots and Doctors/Medics 9) Senate Reform: I feel we need to approach this with a third option. The NDP want it abolished, the Conservatives want an elected senate. I think we should take a new approach. Which is Senate appointed by House of Commons committee.  Short  List made by nominations from the people who live in the region/area of the vacant Senator place. Elections Canada can keep track of the top 5 nominees. And the House of Commons Committee interviews and votes on each nominee. The one with the most votes gets appointed to the Senate.

That s certainly the case, policy-wise for the conservatives, whose policy is that of a single man (and perhaps that s true also for the NDP).",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1"In response to Philip Chisholm s comments, said on Jun 9, 2011 at 6:02 pm  Your suggestions are well received!

Just look at the cost of litre of gas in Venezvala and Saudia Arabia.,1,1,3,1,0,1,1,0,0,1I think the issue is whether Canadians are serious about a alternative to radical right and left parties or whether they are more comfortable with the relatively simple choice between polar opposites. The Liberal Party has been many things to Canadians over the years. We were the party of business; the party that gave dignity to Franco-Canadians and Quebecois; the party of social security and the party of sound economic policy. Do Canadians have the intellectual capacity and will to continue to want our party to pave the pathway between the extremes?,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1"Personal: 1. I knew many people who were indecisive when it came to voting. Many of them did not see the difference between the NDP and Liberal. Most of these people were anti-conservative at heart. They did not vote, because they could not make up their mind. 2. I also knew people who were liberal, but voted NDP, just because they saw the Ontario Liberal party as the party responsible for their lose of hours at work, and also not having their incomes raised (ie. the people who worked in pharmacies). Even if the liberal party was not the responsible party with regards to this, they had been disappointed at the party for what they felt was the party s wrong doing. 3. Some others who I spoke too originally wanted to vote for the liberals, but they accused the liberals for nuisance. They claimed that the party s representatives kept bugging them and pushed for votes. This made them vote for parties other than Liberals. Domestic: 1. Living in Downtown Toronto during the Olympic games, I witnessed a general sense of pride amongst people of every race and colour, regardless of their status in Canada, whenever Canada won something. People used to pour into the streets and dance and celebrate. I feel that it is extremely important for Canadians to feel that way. In order to have better outcomes in our voter turnouts we need to make the voters feel like this country is their real home. Unfortunately, many people who live here feel that Canada is only their second home. A safe-house where they can grow and flourish and become someone who can improve the lives of the people in their  real home . Canada should become the place that Canadians miss when they are away from her. 2. Future Canada is going to be strategically challenged for her resources in the Arctic. It is our responsibility to be able to defend our borders. This means we need a stronger economy, and a much stronger home-made technology. We need to improve our industry and rely more on ourselves rather than being dependent on powers around us. We should be the ones who export technology. 3. Education is the most important factor that causes progress, and will directly effect the future of a country. It needs to be taken more seriously. More money needs to be invested in this area. A Canadian university student should not be forced to take part-time job in order to be able to pay for the continuously rising university fees. University should not be a business. University is the place where the future of the country is built, not the place where a hand-full of business men become rich. Global: 1. We need to preserve our environment. It is essential that we do not destroy our surrounding. Once the environment is gone the country will slowly start to decline. Environmental concerns are not only regional, but also global. Therefore, we need a global organization to effectively function and prevent further destruction of our planet. 2. We are entering a post-modern age, where nation-states are slowly being replaced by regional, and eventually continental unions. A global federation is not far from reality, but are we ready for it? We need to help and improve the level of every state around the world, so that they are compatible with one another. This will establish a balance of power, where everyone is truly equal. Whether we like it or not, globalization is upon us and we need to ensure that we are all ready for that. Canada is a small form of a global community, where people of multiple cultures and backgrounds have come together and are living in a relatively peaceful society. Even though Canada is not perfect, it should be considered as a working example by the communities across the globe, in order for them to resolve their issues and come together as simply humans. This will bring prosperity and progress to the humankind as a whole. 3. Canada should indirectly promote liberal and democratic values. Direct intervention in countries such as Iran is only going to cost the democratic movements in such countries, as they will be labeled as  spies of the west . We need to find democratic societies in these regions that share more cultural values with the  targeted  societies. We need to improve these democratic societies and make them an example for the other countries. Once the democratic  achievements become obvious all other societies in the area follow suit.",1,2,3,1,2,1,0,0,0,1"It is my humble opinion regardless of who becomes the next leader, unless the Party executive enact ALL of the changes suggested in the Commission For Change report, I believe our party will continue to founder. There are concrete suggestions tabled, some I know were instituted just recently, but it was too little, too late, imho. I was one of those who never or rarely received responses to my emails, (locally and from Party HQ), was flooded with constant emails soliciting funds(even though I contributed at the leaders dinner, during the campaign, and am a Victory Fund member), and quite frankly, was never really encouraged as a new Liberal to get involved save prior to the election. I was not informed of my local AGM (this approximately six months after I had joined the party!) It sorely tested my committment to the party. I noticed about four months prior to the election, things had started to improve. Town halls actually made me feel part of the party, and I noticed that correspondence to HQ was at least being answered. My question is, if the executive had two years to implement these recommendations, why didnt the executive do it? ..I know change takes time, but the executive could have acted on a few of the key ones. If the executive had, perhaps the unfortunate result of May 2nd could have been improved upon. http://cdn.liberal.ca/files/2010/05/change-commission-report.pdf Please know this is constructive criticism. But if this party is to ever achieve Govt again, it is imperative the party brass start listening to the grass roots. The old days of making a few phones calls are, as we all know, long gone. Platitudes are not what we need .Action is. Sincerely, Patrick Hamilton",1,2,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1I believe the amendments stated above are appropriate for this time.,1,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,0,1"Regarding the proposed motions to amend the constitution: I am in support of the motion to defer the leadership selection until at least January 2013. The party truly needs time for the membership to have a genuine dialogue amongst the members first. Clearly, setting a consensus on identity, direction, values and purpose is needed before a leader is chosen who will then help to move the party towards the fulfillment of the vision. That vision may well be very similar to the vision that currently drives this party, ..but confirming that through authentic conversation is just as valid as the development of a new vision. Regardless, ..vision & mission first   leadership to light the way second. Secondly, it would be unfair to put a new leader that does not have a clear party focus behind him/her out on the front bench in Parliament there to be chewed up once again by the unrelenting and misleading Tory attack machine. Let Jack & the NDP fight that battle for a couple years before we set a new permanent leader in the front bench. As a party we have done a very poor job of protecting both the integrity and reputation of our last two leaders. We need to know how to play the game better before we do the same to a third permanent leader. Mr. Rae is a veteran of many battles with very thick skin, sharp mind and a hardened edge. He is without a doubt the best person to  hold the fort  while the membership regroups and established a strong plan of action. We should be thankful that he is willing to make this sacrifice on behalf of the party at this time. My only hesitation on the motion as it stands is that I believe January 2012 may still be a bit early to roll out a new permanent leader. While it does give the newly chosen leader significant time to allow Canadians to get to know him/her, it also allows for significant time in which the new leader s reputation and credibility could be severely damaged. If we are not very well prepared to address this very predictable action by the Harper hacks when we do finally choose a new permanent leader, this will happen for a third time ..and no amount of policy, mission or vision will fix that!",1,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"In preparation for the June 18th meeting I ve been reading Alfred Apps  June 2011 report to the membership. Since Mr. Apps says he wants open dialogue, I m sure he won t mind me saying that his report spends way too much time fighting old battles, defending the indefensible, and advancing his own positions and point of view. Mr. Apps idea of revitalization is   to focus aggressively and especially on re-engaging women, youth, Aboriginals and new Canadians with a very special and concerted attention to Quebec. They [Liberals] want to say goodbye to a Party dominated so heavily by  middle age white guys  .  Gosh, if only we d thought of that before! Two things are wrong with this approach. The first is that it s just tinkering. It suggests that all we need to do is make some adjustments in our demographics and all will be well. That s simply not our circumstance. Secondly, it sets up a straw-man (those nasty middle age white guys) to target. We need all hands on deck to bring us  round from our recent near-death experience. As inviting as it may be to look for a diversion from the real and fundamental problems we have as a Party, I suggest that looking for scapegoats and generational quick-fixes is not going to lead us to the long-term solutions we so desperately need.

I will not be able to attend the convention, but I do support delaying the leadership vote until sometime in 2012-2013. Unfortunately, Party leaders have become the main focus and many are voting based on the leader and less on policy. We need the time to engage party members and to fundraise. If we get the leader right, and come up with a clear and coherent message to present to Canadians, I think we can win back government in 2015. Michael Ignatieff was framed by the Conservative party, and their attack ads worked wonders. We need to level the playing field when it comes to fundraising. We are lagging behind the Conservatives and as a result the Liberal party was not able to respond to the personal attack ads waged against Mr. Igantieff. I thought that Canadians would not buy the ads, but I was wrong. I think that Mr. Ignatieff would have been an excellent Prime Minister. Leadership will be a big part of renewal, we need leadership that will listen to the grassroots level of the party. We need a leader who can best represent Liberals, while also connecting with the younger generation who will someday be the future of this party. We must plan for the future and do our best to engage as many Canadians as possible. We must work hard and take nothing for granted. I would like to thank all those who are volunteering their time and efforts to help rebuild our party. As party members, we are not always going to be in full agreement on all issues and that is a good thing, we need healthy criticism from time to time, but it is important that we remain united and open minded. Together we will succeed in gaining support for a strong Liberal vision to once again lead this great nation. Thanks",1,2,2,2,2,0,2,0,0,1"Hello all, I m very new here; joined election night (May 2) actually. I simply do not want to see my  voice  erased in the Federal sphere, therefore I decided to declare my allegiances and get involved! To the matter at hand, with the information I have to date, it seems reasonable to me to delay the leadership convention, therefore I support the resolutions put forward. HOWEVER, as a newbie, I want to put forth my observations, with some suggestions for improvements as we move forward. 1) I joined May 2 and have yet to receive a membership card or any  how to be a Liberal  information package. I believe a confirmation email said I could expect something in the mail. It s 2011. Perhaps an option to receive said material via email, or a password to a  members-only  section of the website where such materials are housed would be more timely. It would help me get up to speed on party rules & regs, opportunities to get involved etc. 2) I entered all of my particulars when I joined _ i.e. where I live! I would have thought a near immediate letter of welcome from my local riding association with some  hey, here s some local events you may want to come to  should have followed. While we can communicate and share material virtually, we are still a party of human beings and should make that human connection quickly. 3) This extraordinary convention is a bit frustrating. I appreciate the need for it, and I m glad to see so much encouragement to participate, but I still feel quite  lost . For example, I was interested in participating, but I have small children and have made no connection yet with anybody in my riding association. So, picture this. You are asked to sign up for a teleconference that will occur at an unspecified time and last for who-knows-how-long on a certain date. No idea on the logistics of the phone call, but those will come. You have to list yourself as a certain  type  of delegate, but since you don t know anybody in your area, you have no idea if you re the only one in your riding, or if there are 500 people like you, and none (or all or any) of them agree with you. So, you decide not to put your name in because you just don t have enough detail you can live with that you re new here. Then, you get a letter from your riding telling you all delegates have been acclaimed, but the letter doesn t tell you who they are, or even if we met (or are significantly below) our delegate quota. How are  we  the members of the riding to inform  our  delegates of our preferences in this convention? Apparently a non-issue as we don t know who they are, so it seems  delegate  is a loose term more like  pre-registered voters . How will these mystery  delegates  vote? I guess I ll find out some time after June 18. For a party wanting to embrace grass-roots and transparency and all of those other lovely buzz-words, we re clearly not there yet. Looking forward to continued discussion I m going to check out enfamille.ca as suggested by someone else here. We need to do more than just virtually discuss however. Perhaps some of these discussions need to move into our ridings and gel into resolutions/policies for the next convention. Perhaps that is how things already work, but like point #1 says, I m not in a position to have a clue yet .",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1"Just an idea regarding Senate reform: Has anyone thought of the  German solution  or a version of it, namely a second chamber made up of members of the provincial legislatures? Seems to work rather well over there ",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1"Firstly, I support the proposed amendments. We need time to think and discuss policy and values before we choose a leader to carry those forward. Bob Rae is a fine interim leader and while the NDP are the official opposition, we can enjoy a bit of benign neglect in the public eye while we pull things together. January 2013 would give the new leader two and a half years to start building his/her profile in the House. That s a good timeframe. As for concerns voiced here that choosing a leader that early would give the Cons too much time to smear the new leader: Respectfully, this is nonsense. We re not going to form another government by hiding from fights and unveiling our leader the day before the writ is dropped. (Anyway, you can rest assured that Harper s people are going through our bench and putting together strategies for trashing each and every one of the possible leaders.) Our last two leaders were smeared unfairly, this is true. We re going to have to get better at anticipating and fighting back against this. But to lay it all at the feet of the Harper smear machine is to overlook the fact that our leaders had real weaknesses, and by extension so did our leadership selection process. I say this with the utmost respect and admiration for Messrs. Dion and Ignatieff, who I believe would have been fine prime ministers. But to become prime minister you first have to win a federal election. Mr. Dion s lack of facility in English put him at a critical disadvantage in communicating with the anglophone parts of the country. (The same reason, but w/r French, is why_with great regret_I was unable to cheer for Gerry Kennedy in 2006.) Our next leader needs, among many other things, to be fluently bilingual, able to *own* a debate in either language. As for Mr. Ignatieff: I was shocked by the animosity against him that I heard while canvassing. But I also never understood why he was the favourite of a small but intractable plurality in the 2006 leadership convention. And I understood even less why, once we lost the 2008 election, there was a rush to crown him. It was as if the cadre who supported him the first time around managed to persuade everyone (weary, condescending voice here)  Okay, you ve gotten your chance to play your little not-having-Iggy game, now can we just grow up and get down to the serious business of putting Iggy in charge?  Yes, if you squinted, you could consider him the second coming of Pierre Trudeau (the philosopher king) and Mike Pearson (the foreign affairs genius.) But in practical terms, he had been out of the country for far too long and he had just been parachuted into the safest riding in the country and had never undergone a real election. To be blind to these flaws_especially the second one!_is hard to justify. Look_successful leaders don t just fall into your lap. It doesn t work that way. What happens is you find talent and you recruit it and you give it time to get experience and to work on its weaknesses, and then you put it in charge. All of which is to say: We have four and a half years before the next election. We have rushed to judgement before. Okay, arguably we had to; these were minority government situations and we had to be ready to roll at a month s notice. But that isn t the terrain anymore. The terrain has changed. We have a lot of challenges but we also have some key advantages. These are: (1) knowing we have time (2) being out of the public eye for the next little while, and (3) having gotten a very clear and unambiguous wake-up call that tells us beyond any reasonable doubt that what we have been doing isn t working and needs to be overhauled. These are precious gifts. Let s not waste them.",1,2,0,2,2,0,1,0,0,1"I have followed and have voted Liberal since I was much younger. I was so upset with Harper that I decided to join the Liberal party and try to help it win the recent election. However, I was quite amazed at how ignorant and non scientific the liberal approach to climate change was. I was especially disturbed by stephane dionnes adoption, whole hog, of the issue, without a shred of science to back him up. My background is in chemical engineering as well as chemistry and biochemistry. Using the skills and knowledge gained i looked at the issue from those standpoints and discovered, much to my surprise, that the IPCC and Al Gore were in fact basing their claims on unproven models and not on hard measured science. It in fact called David McGuint y office and spoke to a person there , who acknowledged that it would be very hard to get the Liberal party to abandon it s stand on climate change. If the party wishes to build a ground up based party it must have a leader who is at least as smart as I am and who can equally understand the science issues as well as there ramifications on our economy and societal issues. It is utterly foolish to jump on a bandwagon, without understanding the issues associated with the wagon. I am terribly disappointed in the whole issue of climate change and how badly it has been blamed on the wrong thing. I have been studying these issues for the better part of 2 years now and from all the data available it seems more likely that our climate is affected by sunspots more than it is by anything humans can do to it. Bad science can be like lies spreading around the globe before thruth gets its shoelaces tied., to paraphrses Mark Twain. I am willing to debate anyone anywhere about the issues of climate change and why this party should revise it s policies to reflect the truth and make them our own. The Conservative party s stand is unfortunately the correct one but it like the liberals doesn t know why. and cannot elucidate it . We need to focus on our past successes and bring them to bear on future possibilities. We also need to establish and reaffirm our core priorities and build upon a solid foundation. This did not happen in the last election . We can take advantage of Mr. layton s adoption of the climate change to recover the seats he was able to take from us. It is my opinion that we need a leader and leadership which can understand and elucidate our policies clearly and without any misgivings, by knowing and understanding the facts of any and all issues.",1,2,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1We need an effective strategy to win back voters and seats lost to the NDP. People have gotten the wrong image of the Party and that has to be changed by reaching out to the grassroots. We have to be projected as a viable alternative to the NDP and a strong challenge to the Conservatives. The Conservatives are unrealistic in thinking they can balance the budget in just three years and when that does not happen we have to be there to point out the policy flaws and their game of deception. The people have to understand that politics is not a shell game it starts with listening to the public and doing a serious reality check to not overpromise on policies or any issue. We need to formulate a strong environmental policy as well as economic policy. The choosing of a permanent leader should not be put off for too long; the date ranges are realistic as proposed in the constitutional amendments but it is better a little sooner than later so the public has more time to get to know this leader and gain confidence and trust. We need a strong diplomatic leadership that will win the respect and support of more Canadians.,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1"I don t see where there s an option on this page to reply directly to authors, so I just wanted to say to Tanya Misak and to Tim Moerman that I strongly agree with the points you raise. Tanya, in particular, your comment regarding the fact that your local riding association has made no effort to contact you (much less to welcome you into the party!) is one that is particularly important to me. I was involved in my local riding association a few years ago, and I would BEG for contact info re members in our riding who had newly joined. I really wanted to welcome these people, and to find out what had motivated them to join the party (people, I think, generally don t make the decision to join a political party unless there s one or more policy issues they think the party is most likely to support, and I wanted to get a sense as to what those issue were in order to advance policy ideas up the chain in the party). But, I was repeatedly told that such information wasn t available to the riding association. This was only one example of the lack of interest I thought was exhibited in the party with respect to forming some meaningful bond with its grassroots. Frankly, I will say that I was almost never asked my opinion on any policy matter, despite the fact that I have been a practicing lawyer and have several advanced degrees. Really, people were just more interested in my money, or rather my connections to it, as they seemed to feel that the only thing wrong with the liberal party was its lack of funds. So I left the riding association executive, and let my membership lapse (though I ve since renewed it, as there s really no other party which is capable of reflecting my fundamental beliefs). Comments like those by Tanya and Tim make me realize that I can t give up on this party, as there are clearly people who care about the party despite the fact that, frankly, the party has acted for several years as though it doesn t need to care much about those who support it. So, thank you both.",1,1,3,1,1,0,2,0,0,1I have some very strong opinions on the future of the Liberal Party of Canada. Unfortunately it is difficult to put in a short few words my concerns and hopes for the party and for Canada. Ironically (I think that s the correct use of the word ironically :-) ) just today there is a post on the American Website DailyKos that really captures exactly my thoughts on the future of liberalsim and progressivism. These are the exact principles that I believe the Liberal Party of Canada MUST adopt once again (or maybe actually for the first time). http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/06/09/983372/-The-Failure-of-Liberalism?via=spotlight Thanx for this opportunity to express my beliefs.,1,2,1,2,0,0,1,0,0,1"I am profoundly disappointed in the results of the recent election but have great hopes for the Party as we move ahead over the next 4 years. In response to Mr. Apps  plea for input, I urge the Party to implement a project to stimulate local militants and prepare them to undertake a major drive to build awareness and increase Party membership. To do this I suggest the following: Prepare an information package that local riding association members and supporters can use to inform friends and neighbours of the values and intentions of the Liberal Party. The package should contain points to discuss with potential members/supporters in order to help them understand why the Liberal Party is their best choice. Some things that should be included in the information for local workers to pass on are: a. what the Liberal Party stands for (in straight forward one and two syllable words), how specifically it has implemented this philosophy in the past and how it intends to promote it in the future, b. the benefits of membership in the Party, c. income tax treatment of membership fees and donations to the Party, d. how they can participate in the promotion of the Party, e. information tailored to specific regions on how Liberal beliefs and policies relate to local issues, and for Quebec residents in particular, f. frank and open discussion of the Liberal party history including the sponsorship scandal (still our main stumbling block in Quebec), g. how a Liberal majority government would deal with Quebecers  aspirations. As part of this move to spread the Liberal word and bring more people into the Party, local workers would need some form of hands on training to prepare them to meet people and carry put the task I propose. This is necessary to avoid gaffs and to maximize the return on workers  efforts. In addition to promoting the Liberal party, workers on the ground must also be attentive to the needs and aspirations of those with whom they come into contact. The workers must transmit what they are hearing back to their riding association and be able to follow up and bring accurate replies back to voters who have asked questions. The essence of the above information should be prepared in a concise pamphlet that workers can leave in the hands of those they contact along with a membership form and information on local contacts (ideally of course, the object would be to sign up new members on the spot). A campaign based on this proposal should be begun as quickly as possible in order to capitalize on the bewilderment of voters following the May 2nd election. Permit me to state the obvious: brevity and clarity are essential here, since many people will not take the trouble to read through a long, pedantic discussion of political philosophy. Local riding associations, being the ones who will implement this program, will need to be helped to prepare for giving the required training to their workers.",1,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"IMHO as long as the current Liberal President (Apps) and the current executive that were directly responsible for the last election outcome (not just Ignatieff s fault)are in place there can be no meaningful change or rebuilding taking place in the LPC  BTW _  It s the economy stupid  is the main thing to always remember  Learn it well  Chretien/Martin knew that, that s where the CENTER is, and acted accordingly giving Canada Balanced Surplus Budgets and prosperity  Harper knows it too (talking the talk and NOT walking the walk) and when the Liberal Party went  hard LEFT  instead of staking out their traditional base in the CENTER the LPC played right into Harper s agenda and froze thousands of Liberals like myself out   Corporate tax cuts and Jets and Jails  are egually as bad as  social spending  during deficit times since they both simply defer debt onto our kids and grandkids doing nothing to  fix  the economy FIRST  Good start last election, terrible strategy as soon as the  Red Book  of social spending confused the public and took the LPC off their originial message making them  NDP light  instead of a fiscally responsible alternative to Harper  Sad, sad, sad, and totally STUPID ",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1"I have full support the ideas and plan of the party explaining by the President of the party Alfred Apps .

I agree. Let s build up from the grass roots because this is what is sustainable. However, there is a difference in the grass roots of the conservatives and the liberals _ the liberal grass roots is urban and more educated relative to the conservative grass roots. This difference means that the tactics used by the conservative party to buiild its grass roots are unlikely to work for the liberal party and this is something that should be kept in mind when the strategy is being formulated. I also think that the liberal organization has to be better. For example, I joined the liberal party about in April but have yet to receive my membership card. It s a very small issue, but then it is an easy one to addresss and if we cannot get these easy things right, what about the big ones? I hope this is an isolated incident. To summarize, working on the grassroots and building a better organization will be a good start.",1,2,0,1,0,1,2,0,0,1I like what I hear here  A lot of good comments  We just need everyone to bring their ideas to the table and motivate everyone around us to join our cause.,1,0,1,2,3,0,2,0,0,1"Apart from the resolutions at hand, are we ready to talk about the Liberal Democrats? It is the one item that many Liberals and NDPers are thinking but are not willing to articulate.",1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1"I believe one of the most important things that the Liberal Party can do is increase internal democracy of the party. We also must aspire to do as the Conservatives have done, which is to create a core of Conservatives only voters. These are the militants that will talk to others about our values, fundraise, donate and promote. The next thing is to give up the left and head back to the centre. There are simply not enough votes there. This does not mean that we become Conservative-light. Lastly, although some other members have mentioned that policy is not the issue, I believe that it is. Coming from rural northern Ontario, I found policies that answered to people s everyday wants and needs simply did not exist. Look to our history and step away from the shift to unfetered capitalism. We can be both business friendly without giving up our environmental heritage and destroying the middle class at the same time.

This lively and rich discussion has touched upon many of the key issues to be discussed in the upcoming ECOSOC session.  For those who are just joining the e-discussion, you will find below a summary of the comments posted during the first two weeks. If you had not done so already, I encourage you to have your say and join the discussion.   This report summarizes the first two weeks of the global e-discussion for Thematic Window 1 on eradicating poverty and leaving no one behind, with over 120 responses from all regions of the world.  Leaving no one behind in the effort to eradicate poverty is to return to the essence of our humanity. Even when growth lifts millions out of poverty, many will be left behind unless explicit policies are implemented with this aim. Yet poverty reduction efforts are not likely to be sustainable unless they tackle the underlying drivers of poverty such as exclusion, vulnerability, and environmental degradation.",1,2,3,2,0,2,2,0,0,1"Poverty and development is very much interwoven with the nature and type of governance. Democratic and inclusive governance may be an effective system against poverty and drive force for inclusive development both at macro and micro levels. .However we need to highlight on the following steps:1. Enhancing human resource development through measures on education, health and livelihood generation. Initiating appropriate skill and vocational training programmes in relevance to technological, entrepreneurship development.2. Developing a registry of skills and skill exchange mechanism to generate appropriate demand and supply in the market.3. Enabling measures for access to credit and finance from relevant agencies may be for enterprise development.4. Strengthening farm and non-farm sectors as pivot for employment generation and enterprise development.Besides macro policy initiatives need to be monitored and implemented at macro-micro continuum to achieve the desired result, i.e. poverty eradication and inclusive development. ",1,2,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"To add to the notes on adjusting policies to support co-operatives, I would like to highlight the specific ways in which co-operatives serve as tools for eradicating poverty and how the UN and its Member States could support their development in a practical way.Firstly, co-operatives can be a self-help solution for people to pull themselves out of poverty when external economic opportunities are scarce. Individuals can identify the gaps in a community (whether that be farmers' access to markets, sources of capital for small-scale loans, a food retail outlet, etc.), and form a co-operative to address that gap in a democratic, principles-driven space. Through the power of the collective, co-operatives allow people to create their own opportunities where few others exist.Secondly, co-operatives have concern for community at their core, being member-based organizations. Without the pressure of shareholders to focus on the bottom line, co-operatives are businesses that reinvest in their communities while securing the livelihoods of their members. Examples can be seen in how co-operatives reinvest revenues into building schools and educational programs for community members, offering professional development opportunities, or developing more environmentally friendly systems for waste and energy use. This means that co-operatives can not only eradicate poverty among individuals, but also contribute to the greater wealth of communities as a whole.Regarding the policies that need to be adjusted to achieve the SDGs, it would be ideal for the UN to better include the co-operative movement in global policy making processes to reflect their important economic and social impact, and for UN Member States to review their national/regional legislation related to co-operatives and consider making it easier for co-operatives to be established and to flourish. This would include provisions to make financing more accessible to co-operatives, which is one of their most significant challenges, given the lack of understanding about the unique co-operative identity.Opening the door for co-operatives to grow is a win-win situation: Member States can see greater achievement of the SDGs, and co-operatives can better meet the needs of their members and communities.",1,3,3,1,3,2,1,0,0,1"Poverty eradication? This will requires eradication of wealth as well. Environmental and social justice depends on fighting inequalities, who will support?",1,1,3,1,1,0,1,0,0,1"The United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda have identified 17 goals with 169 associated targets, and has set Goal 1 and Goal 2, as priorities. The aim of Goal 1 is to end poverty everywhere in all forms by 2030 during the next 15 years, and the aim of Goal 2 is to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture.Based on a report published by the Corner House, a non-governmental organization, the goals, though ambitious, are achievable if corruption alone was eliminated. Specifically, it is reported in the article entitled   ìExporting Corruption   ñ Privatisation, Multinationals and Bribery,  ù that   ìwestern businesses pay bribes to the tune of $80 billion a year   ñ roughly the amount the United Nations believes is needed to eradicate global poverty.  ù   Such greed mimics current politics in the U.S. to increase the wealth of the rich while robbing $800 billion from the poor. In addition to eliminating corruption and greed, according to Susan George, in her   ìA Fate Worse Than Debt,  ù (New York: Grove Widenfeld, 1990, pp. 1143, 187, 235), structural adjustment policies prescribed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank gravely contributes to poverty worldwide; especially, for small countries.   In particular, it is noted that the IMF and the World Bank  »s structural adjustment policies and practices, which are comparable to loan sharking in the U.S, impose rigid   ìpre-conditions  ù on small countries in order for them to receive funds, creating an inherent imbalance of power.  Moreover, Susan George stated the food aid provided by developing countries amounts to   ìfood dumping,  ù further impeding economic growth by controlling smaller countries and forcing small farmers out of business through   ìmonopoly capitalism.  ùAdditionally, based on a report entitled,   ìDifferences in Anti-Poverty Approaches in Europe and The United States: A Cross-Atlantic Descriptive Policy Analysis,  ù by Koen Caminada and Megan C. Martin of Leiden University,   ìin all OECD countries, public cash benefits and taxes significantly reduce poverty.  However, the report notes the   ìpolicy goals for reducing poverty rates are rather vague and do not aspire to a specified target on either side of the Atlantic.  ù  It would also be noteworthy to review the policies of Iceland, Finland, Cyprus, Norway and the Netherlands, who actually have the lowest poverty rates.In essence, new policies must enforce and implement international trade and human rights laws prohibiting unequal trade, ensure vulnerable countries are not disadvantaged by developing countries, and policies must institute consensus-building and transparency.",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"In order to achieve such goal, we will need the cooperation of governments and commitment.

Similar to Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , or Kyoto Protocol.

However, as today the majority of poor people are living in mid-income countries, for them economic growth of the country is no longer what should be the priority, but growth of the average income in this group. As described by Piketty and others, the prevailing economic mechanisms lead to income polarisation, which implies a growing number of poor, unless targetted re-distributive policies, are effectively implemented. Regarding income redistribution, this can be achieved for instance by progressive taxes financing social services; the Scandinavian countries provide ample evidence for such models. Redistribution of assets is another issue and a major challenge to be achieved peacefully.On leaving no one behindThe concept of the social protection floor, developed by ILO and UNESCO and endorsed by UNCSD Rio de Janeiro 2012 offers a basic concept.

Insurance products are available for various purposes and social/ business segments around the world. However, insurance is often not within the reach of those who need it most. This happens due to multiple reasons. However, for the purpose of managing risk in an inclusive manner, insurance is a time-honored mechanism.I am narrowing the discussion down to 3 broad models of insurance - (i) microinsurance, (ii) social security insurance models and (iii) mutuals and cooperatives. Without getting into definitions and technical intricacies, I would like to briefly discuss these 3 models.In the 1st model - Insurance companies offer microinsurance schemes for people having low income. There are often caps based on the income of the people covered, the sum insured that can be opted or the premiums payable. Usually such policies are offered due to some sort of compulsion from the Government. However, there are insurance companies which are insuring low income populations for years at length and are able to create sustainable microinsurance models over time.The 2nd model is that of social security (cum insurance) schemes, driven by the Government, mostly with subsidized premiums and a strong social security focus. The design helps in transferring unplanned Governmental expenditure for various disaster relief situations (earthquake/ flood/ drought) to an ex-ante risk-financing model, whereby insurance companies become the first port of call for financing disaster costs.The responsibility of creating adequate healthcare infrastructure in a country and maintaining it efficiently to take care of the needs of the population is another challenge of the Government. This model helps in breaking the poverty trap by passing on these responsibilities to private healthcare providers, while the costs of financing major treatment costs get borne by the insurance mechanism.The 3rd model is that of mutuals and cooperatives. These are community based models that work on insurance principles. The major difference is that here the risk is retained and shared within the community, without being transferred to an insurance company.All these models have their own positives and weaknesses. Some models have challenges in being cost effective; some have a high probability of the insured people getting undue benefits at the cost of the insurance mechanism; some are not able to ensure fair claim servicing to the customers; while some other models allow unintended beneficiaries to benefit at the cost of the insured and insurer. Again, some models work well in particular socio-economic contexts while others may not.However, there are many success stories in all these models and with proper thought an planning, the insurance mechanism can ensure that no one is really left behind.If the group is interested in taking these ideas forward, I would be happy to share more thoughts on the topic.",1,3,3,2,0,0,2,0,0,1"Dear George,I am interested in this topic, specifically in people with disabilities.

Yet the walls built are higher to cross over because of the widening gap that exists in financing education to the poorest.

When compared to their peers without disability they get poor education, vocational training that do not meet the market needs (making it difficult to find a job) and unemployment rates that are much more higher than for the other groups.

Local Control and flexibility means money goes to solve problems, not to subsidize bureaucracy.

A wide variety of issues, locally and nationally, are affecting education, and will continue to affect education until these issues are addressed and solved. Overcrowded classrooms, shortages of supplies, low teachers  » salaries, dilapidated buildings, and high substitute teacher use are a few of the issues that have affected many schools across the nation.  Even though a few of these problems have been resolved, many still remain.  These issues are determined by the location of the school and the type of school, either private, public, or charter.  The current issues in education that will influence my teaching, based on my beliefs, pertain to The No Child Left Behind Act, time management, lack of flexibility, school budget cuts, technology, and bullying. Effective in 2001, The No Child Left Behind Act  policy was proposed  in  the US to nationally test all children under the same conditions and with the same test annually in order to prevent students from being trapped in a failing school.  However, the focus on these mandated tests steered the teachings of reading and mathematics to a whole new level.

I have talked to young people in their mid teens who due to ""stunting"" appeared as those aged nine or ten. Something stirs within me...a mix of anger and deep sadness.""Where there is poverty there is malnutrition and systemic hunger. Poverty and hunger are virtually synonymous. The right to adequate food is a human right. So why does hunger prevail when there is more than enough nourishment and food sources on the planet? Hunger is universal. Most humans have gone without a meal or experienced pangs of hunger where a day has gone by without nourishment. Yet there are an estimated 800 million people worldwide who are chronically hungry. This is greater than the populations of Canada, the United States and the European Union combined. One in eight people do not get enough food to be healthy and lead an active life. This makes hunger and malnutrition the number one risk to health worldwide, greater than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined.Presently, due to environmental factors and lack of rain in the north and northeast sectors, there is a severe drought in Kenya. The facts are that 1.6 million Kenyans face hunger on a daily basis. 80 percent of Kenya's population participate in agriculture and pastoralism. Small farm households deliver the bulk of the nation's food supply. Landholdings are small, productivity is low and most have little access to technological inputs, financial services and markets to sell any surplus produce. Poverty and hunger are for many a fact of life. The poor in Kenya are of all ages; from the very young whose mothers cannot produce enough milk, to the aged with no relatives to care for them. Landless farmers working on the fields of others and youth orphaned by HIV/Aids need increased food supply to survive. So too the unemployed living in acute poverty and the ones suffering from mental illness. Women and children remain on the front lines of hunger.The malnourished cannot fight infectious diseases due to lack of protein and vitamin deficiencies. Their food intake does not include enough energy to meet the minimal physiological needs for an active life. Wasting is an indication of acute malnutrition caused by deficiencies in iron, vitamin A, zinc and iodine. This can result in reduced physical growth and mental impairment bringing on premature death.Since 2004, CES Canada's mission to reduce poverty through education and healthcare has created better and healthier learners through a daily nutrition program. The creation of dairy and agriculture farms in schools has enabled students able to concentrate on their studies and not on mere survival. Hand washing stations provide added hygiene that can reduce up to 80% of diseases. Recognizing the importance of Agriculture in Kenyan society and realizing the impact that improved practice and technology has on the supply of food, CES Canada/Kenya has encouraged students to study Agriculture at the college/university level. CES Canada has provided university scholarships for CES grads who are completing honours degrees in Agriculture Economics, Engineering, Business and Education. The fundamental right to be healthy, grow and become productive human beings in their society depends on access to education. Yet, there remains a deeper more sacred right than that...the right to life and liberty, predicated on access to proper food and nutrition. The scourge of hunger in Kenya must be taken out, its bitter roots cut and destroyed.

I live in Argentina so my experience comes from many years of success and failure in our efforts. At the turn of the XXth Century Argentina had a very strong basis as far as the primary and secondary system is concerned, and this was a key factor in the deevelopment Argentina had up to the early fifties (1950's).Without strong bases in primary and also secondary Education, there can be no significant efforts (moneywise) that can effectively win the unreleting struggle against poverty. However, when cheap politics get mixed up in educational efforts, it's one step ahead and two steps back. All of you know that educational strategies require long periods. It is not a question of one governement, but a question of state policies.In 2017 efforts in the edicational field are necessary related to the Sustainable Deveopment Goals. And here there is another kind of challenge. Top and medium ranking officials may be willing to move ahead in order to comply with the respective SD GOALS associated with education and struggle against poverty. However, before they can act efficiently and in coordination with the right government departmednts, they must learn about Sustainable Development, which -if one is to judge by ones own experience-it is not something one can be taught overnight.So, to resume, yes EDUCATION is key in this struggle (health, as Helio says, cannot be separated from Education). And there is work to be undertaken at two levels: that of the officials responsible for coordinating SD GOALS with Education, Health and the Struggle against poverty, and the level where those who are the subject of our struggle need to receive proper primary and secondary education.

I would like to share some thoughts on the question discussed, in regard to disability.Persons with disabilities make up an estimated 15 per cent of the world  »s population, or 1 billion people, of whom an estimated 80 per cent live in developing countries.The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) as the focal point on disability within the UN system has been supporting the General Assembly, ECOSOC and Commission for Social Development in policy development concerning persons with disabilities and their inclusion in society and development.According to the latest resolution adopted recently by the General Assembly of the United Nations ( 71/165, adopted on 11 November 2016)  entitled   ì Inclusive development for persons with disabilities   ì , persons with disabilities are disproportionately affected by poverty.While considerable progress has been made, mainstreaming of disability in development agenda and efforts remains a challenge which in turn impede the endeavour of achieving the development , eliminating poverty in all forms for all everywhere ( SDG1).Available experience and evidence that DESA and others did clearly show that more efforts are needed to strengthen further the normative and operational links to effectively integrate the rights, needs , perspectives and contributions of persons with disabilities in our development policies and programmes.Inclusion of persons with disability and promoting inclusive development for all has been well established as one of human right obligations by the UN Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities which is a legally binding instrument that has been ratified by 172 countries already.To narrow the existing gaps between the international norms and development practices, the economic and social imperative to mainstream disability shall be further appreciated by policy makers and development practitioners of all sectors.This means, disability must be incorporated and mainstreamed in all relevant development policies and practices ranging from poverty reduction strategies , to urban planning of housing and human settlements, public transportation/mobility, public spaces and services such as water and sanitation,  to disaster risk responses and resilience building in all our communities as well as in follow ups , monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the SDGs as well as other development agendas such as the Sendai Framework on Disaster Reduction and New Urban Agenda.In this regard, it is also important to understand and actively promote universal design and environmental accessibility as a collective good that remove barriers, equalising opportunities and facilitating meaningful and effective participation by a broader spectrum of general population, including older persons,  persons with disabilities and many more as both agents and beneficiaries of society and development.  Relevant UN documents, resources and work of the UN in the field of disability can be found at UN ENABLE website: www.org/disabilitiesGeneral Assembly resolutions including the most recent one entitled   ìInclusive development for persons with disabilities (A/RES/71/165)  ù https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/resources/general-assembly.htmlAccessibility and Development: Mainstreaming disability in the post-2015 development agenda (DESA publication, ST/ESA/350)Global status report on Disability and Development ( DESA, Prototype 2015, Unedited)Envision 2030: 17 Goals to transform the world for persons with disabilities at the following link: https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/envision2030.html",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"Corruption has crept in all aspects of life.Managing the finances,and currency and their legality world over has to be systematically dealt by the leaders.Education supposed to be a service sector,registered in several countries as a society or social organisation with no loss no profit organisation and dedicated to research for betterment.But in reality the fees collected,the projects managed,the funds received from federal agencies are not accounted and yearly financial returns and tax is not paid.This has created surplus monies with the so called societies.The loopholes are to be plugged every country.The industries also are on the look out for parking their surplus monies in safe un-taxable heavens,to keep their families safe when regime changes.But the unethical attitude is that the money is their's ,which is not true.So creating corporate governance to make declaration of profit and loss, scrutiny of the produce and the utility of products for society is important.",1,2,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"Corruption is a problem only when it's in the mode of exaction. When officials employ their expertise in enabling facilitations for people to progress and participate in the social progress through an alternative method that doesn't corrupt the system without simply rejecting their claim to not have met the stipulates or criteria, they are justified to receive money as charges. Here, through their expertise they enable progress. Neither do they corrupt the system nor do they corrupt the freedom, progress or living of others. This is why the universal declaration of human rights says, everyone without any, discrimination, has the right to EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK. Without stipulating the salary through pay scale and when the system is not stipulated to a periodic elevation that's based on merely on seniority, why would one earn money in black that's neither of visible use to him nor has a value of self-worth? For example, say, I need to start up a business. The procedure to get my start-up registered needs a list of documents as identity and proof. I may not be having the asked document but I may have some other means to proof the details. If the concerned official could ease out this complication and through the process with an alternative that serves the purpose, he/she may regulate me accordingly without burdening with pressures or complications and collect a specific amount as charges. Later, he/she can claim for extra salary apart from the scale of pay stipulated for his/her designation by the government as they have enabled a facilitation through their expertise that would benefit the state's progress and that would increase the employment opportunities of the state (equal pay for equal work) or could add this facilitation enabled through their expertise their credential for elevation. This would eradicate the need for earning money in deceit. In India, we had an initiative to account the unaccounted money. Bringing the unaccounted money back would have been possible if it was offered to accountability with 1% of tax on it. 50% tax to accountability would take away huge amount of what one has as his economic value or life standards forcing them to resist from bringing the amount held back to accountability whereas if we could account it with just 1% as tax it would be meagre for individual but huge for government as 1% of the entire 2 billion US dollar stated just by Swiss bank accounts would be 20 million US dollar. 1% tax could be for individual who wish to invest the amount in entrepreneurial activities that would facilitate the nation to increase its job openings, increase citizen  »s living standards &multiply the economic &developmental value of the nation. Others who wish to have that for their personal use may pay a bit higher percentage as a tax. Same is the case to account the money thats here in India, If the concerned individual has invested the money in an entrepreneurial or in the nation  »s activities that scopes to development we can have it accounted for 1% tax. This would help everyone to volunteer their unaccounted money as no one would want to live in pressure or have money that serves no purpose. Government shouldn  »t average the prosperity of its citizen when it progresses the value of the nation. Averaging citizen  »s prosperity averages the nation  »s prosperity.Instead, when we take an control measure imposing authoritative approach, people would find an alternative way to either safeguard the money or themselves from the system. This in no way is going to serve the purpose or bring in the change we intended. Meanwhile, when the system isn  »t reformed, the accounted money is yet again going to be spent on public works that again has a chance for hoarding that repeats the cycle.   Taxing people is not democracy. Why do we tax people with the money they earn out their work? Government can collect charges for the facilitation it enables to people, it cannot tax them periodically for their progress and prosperity. It is not ethical for government to tax people for helping in its development. Fees is another exaction but expecting education to be absolutely free on the other hand in is also a kind of exaction. Today, second generation learners in a family can take care of their learning independently with the help of their parents. With, Internet information resources is thrown open to different depth, learning individual is free to communicate with experts at any corner of the world for their guidance, to them education can be free. For first generation learners who completely stay dependent on a system for their education needs to pay for the facilities provided to them for their education. Teaching is not absolutely a service. They don't restrict or limit their expertise, they teach until the learner is confident about perceiving the concept in full for his best, they are always available to help you, by this, they attain the state of service but basically for the work they do, they need to be recognised and rewarded. The same is the case to volunteerism. The work of volunteers cannot be sidelined as service.  They are also accounted in the per capita income, GDP, GNP and development calculations of the world. Volunteering is not free service, volunteering is a concept where individual forwards on their own to contribute their skill or expertise in progressing the world without being asked to in a place that needs it. It's an act of slavery to exact potentials or labour from an individual for free to benefit others. Officially including the service volunteered by an individual for their employment opportunities would both reduce the unemployment rate, poverty and even hunger.Ensuring that everyone within the governance is enabled with due opportunities for living and development is the basic responsibility of the government. By Constitution and by UDHR, government's basic and foremost duty is to enable facilitations claimed by their citizens for their progress and prosperity in line with their individuality. With democracy, people are no more dependent on society for their living neither could they be governed by the social norms. It's the duty of the concern representative of the constituency to up bring the ignorant who are tied down by the social structures and social norm in the rural area to get connected with the government and cognise themselves with the responsible use of their freedom and the freedom they have in designing their means to fulfil their responsibility towards the world that enabled them with their living.Helping others to be skilful, helping others in their work and progress is humanity. Helping others with their needs while keeping them idle and unemployed is not humanity but an injustice we are doing to them and the world.   ìThe saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.  ù - Isaac Asimov  ìIt would be possible to describe everything scientifically, but it would make no sense; it would be without meaning, as if you described a Beethoven symphony as a variation of wave pressure.  ù - Albert EinsteinToday education is purely and merely science. The spread of unethical means is because we see everything as science and engineer the world for our desires and wishes. Research is not finding what an everything under the world is made up of, understanding how it evolved is science but investigating on the elements, its constituents, the percentage of constituents in it to the accuracy of .00000001% is too much of science. It shows the arrogance and egoism of humanity to take control over nature that existed several centuries before the origin of humanity and that which stands as the place of origin for everything in and around the world.Even though we have value education as a subject in our curriculum, how much of importance are we giving to it? How much importance is given to language for the reason of it not being calculated for our cut-off? Towards what is our facilitation of education focused on? Is it on the gain of knowledge or on fulfilling the requirements of the system to get a high percentage of scores? Research is not proving the already existing facts but research is about finding a new way to resolve the problem existing in the world with the knowledge gained. Than testing the knowledge of students through a written examination that assesses how thorough they are with the content of the book, if the students are facilitated for an assessment that tests how skilled they are in practicalizing their knowledge through a research project or dissertation that resolves an existing problem in the world would make both assessment and facilitation of education purposeful. When the stipulates of the world are set free for the purpose and when education is reformed from being industrious that manufactures human potential for a set specification to a place that nurtures the human potential for their individuality, neither there would be unethical activities corrupting the world, nor there would be lack of opportunities impoverishing the populace.

Nowhere I spoke about legalising bribe. Bribe is when someone dishonestly persuade to act in favour for someone illegally with money and gift.  All that I said was, than rejecting a claim for progress for not meeting the procedure, it can be facilitated with an alternative that meets the purpose. There's nothing illegal or dishonest here. 1% tax would look small but 1% from a population of 1 billion or more is a huge one. When our intention is to bring the unaccounted money to accountability, that no more remains as an individual's personal wealth. It comes as an investment to serve the nation with its progress and in increasing its employment opportunities.Universal declaration of human rights says that  ¢ everyone and endowed with the right to reason and conscience,  ¢ no one shall be subjected to heavier penalty,  ¢ everyone without any discrimination has right to equal pay for equal work,  ¢ everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection,  ¢ everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his controlprovided that exercise all these right be in a progressive manner that doesn't destroy other's freedom to life and prosperity. Any secondary policy, charter or guideline that undermines the primary principles guidelined through the fundamentals automatically looses its validity.Mistakes are to be punished/ Mistakes are to be regulated and corrected, which in these is democratic? While confiscating something that has been a part in building one's life standards or accomplishment, aren't we pulling a brick that has a possibility of shattering the entire building? Along with the accusation and confiscation, we brand them corrupted seizing their future to end. Is it not a way that pushes one to poverty? How did he acquire the wealth? Did they print the currency on their own? Did they steal it from others reservatory without their knowledge? It was possible for the loopholes in the system. Than letting one to benefit through the loopholes in the system that compromises on the quality of service, why don't we legally enable benefits to one who strengthens the system by multiplying its facilitations? Here I am not talking about bribe or anything that lets one be dishonest to his values or place of work or work ethics. Eg: To reject an application of an industry for its activity to pollute the environment, the official can guide them with methodologies that will help them to treat the refuses of their activities without harming the environment. Or to reject an application because it did not annexe listed proof of address or identity, the official can pass the application by asking the applicant to provide any document that would prove the same. It's not essential that proof should be made through the list of document stated by the department. Here we are not doing anything illegal or dishonest but easing the process for individual in a legal and just manner. Not just the UN employee, anyone whose work serves the system or organisation above the stipulated job responsibility and beyond the framework of duties and stipulations set to him gets salary beyond their stipulated scale of pay. ""So  the king and business man draws money beyond what is stipulated for them even in a democratic set up for his /her services."" I don't know what or who is referred to as king here. This is what is your responsibility, this is what is your pay. We don't bother about what you have to provide, you may have skills that could serve and progress the state above what is stipulated to you, we don't bother about it. You may not be able to meet the stipulated responsibility but you may have a different methodology to serve the same purpose, we neither do bother about it. This is what is stipulated for you, abide by it even if you are best at a different technique or way of work and stick to it even if you have expertise more than the expected, else leave the system. Is this democratic? This is both autocracy and slavery.Copyright law, intellectual property right (IPR) are all a tool to reserve the recognition of a work to the concerned individual. It doesn't reserve the work or content, it just reserves and permanents recognition to the concerned individual for the work. Is it not a basic duty or morale of a society to credit the work to its author or inventor? Why do we need legal imposition for everything? Isn't it an unfortunate thing that the world need legal impose or force for it be humane? If we are to commercialise the concept found by others we are bound to share the earnings as royalty or even if we are to commercialise a part of the concept or if we are to commercialise others content elaborating and furthering the concept contributed by others, due share must be given to them as royalty. It's basic. It's the pathetic situation of world's human values and ethics to demand a legal enforcement for its populace to live justifiedThe limitation of Copyright law or IPR ends there. It cannot prevent others to proceed the findings of a copyrighted or registered content. It cannot prevent others to take the registered content as reference for their work. Knotting down content and progress isolated and halfway through rights is injustice we are doing to the world and to the concept of education. When your role in a concept for your exposure, skill and expertise ends with 30%  it doesn't mean that it has to be left there as such. If another individual has the expertise to advance it to 60% or 90% he can do it by crediting the 30% to the individual from who he got the baton in the relay. Having done to 60 or 90, if another individual has the expertise to advance the concept to 120 or 200, he can by crediting the individual who passed the baton to him that would eventually credit the contributor who initiated the concept. This is progress (development). Copyrights and IPRs register and reserves recognition in the process. I never said, education can exact money as they wish. I just said people working in education system needs to paid for their work for which the facilitating system need to generate revenue and can collect fees from the student.All my points are very well supported by the fundamentals to which the functioning of UN and its organisations are anchored on.

I have explained both these aspects that you have highlighted in my second reply itself.""When officials employ their expertise in enabling facilitations for people to progress and participate in the social progress through an alternative method that doesn't corrupt the system without simply rejecting their claim to not have met the stipulates or criteria, they are justified to receive money as charges.""""While in service of any corporation, not even of government or UN system this receipt of money is balently illegal and unacceptable.""I clearly mentioned that the employee could charge their service. When money is received as a charge for service, it goes to the system or organisation from where the individual could claim salary equalling his/her pay. Demanding money for doing a job wouldn't bring the currency to accountability that eventually reduces the economic value of the nation but the same is claimed as charges, it comes into accountability ensuring all the money printed by the nation is in the flow for the nation's developmental activities. In the routine, we have set the system to a specific standard. We have imposed people with stipulations that they need to meet the set eligibility criteria for their development through the design of system stipulated by us, the government does nothing to ease their process or include them in the facilitations enabled to them. It's people who take up all pressures, stress, hardship and find a way out for themselves amongst the limited opportunities enabled to the entire population. At last, when they have reached a place in their life, government demands a share from the earning that they accomplished by themselves sweating their blood out. We just don't tax for their earning but also tax their earning and accomplishments to balance the subsidies we enable to the needy. How justified, acceptable and legal is this? Enable prosperity to all by facilitating democracy and collect charges from the individual to whom the service was facilitated. Don't overburden a group of populace bringing their accomplishment to general treasury to benefit those in need? What is the responsibility of government shared here?Also, are the taxed amount into progressive use? No, they are yet again into the system that has a loophole for hoarding, that again puts the money to unaccountability, depriving both the economic and social value of the nation.Why wouldn't it be acceptable or legal to ease the facilitations of the citizens to their individual skill, ability, and talent by duly regulating their claims in line with the fundamentals adopted and nominally charge for the service rendered to them in enabling them with their progress or prosperity? We (government) take part and charge for service rendered. Isn't it the duty of government to include individuals in their facilitations? Isn't it the duty of government to help all of its citizens to progress and accomplish prosperity in their life which would cumulate to form the value and progress of the nation?Again this cannot be considered as personal favour, as favouring is when we blindly facilitate people with whatever they ask, violating the fundamental principles but facilitating people with the claims regulating it in line with the fundamental principles and by orienting the people's activities in line with the fundamentals adopted is the job responsibility of the government officials and social responsibility of all components constituting the world. Don't we have a concept of service charge? Doesn't bank charge service charge for using its service? Like mobile alert, for facilitating the customers with loan? Are they illegal? Doesn't restaurants charge service charges for the service they make? ""I need to start up a business. The procedure to get my start-up registered needs a list of documents as identity and proof.

But when the official processes my application with the alternative document of proof I have with me, thats an improved way of fulfilling their job responsibility along with fulfilling their social responsibility. And this alternative facilitation wouldn't just stop with me but for all approaching for facilitation. How could this be called as a personal favour? ""Social responsibility is an ethical framework and suggests that an entity, be it an organization or individual, has an obligation to act for the benefit of society at large.""When the fundamentals of the government says everyone are free and entitled to receive opportunities to development for their individuality, our approach of standardising and stipulating the system and reserving opportunities to few as quota that violates the fundamental principles by uniforming the facilitation and discriminating people based on their gender, religion and caste is a personal favour which unfortunately is considered legal by the nation. Enabling opportunity to all for their individuality in line with the fundamental principles relaxing the stipulates and rules of the system is responsibility whereas enabling opportunity to few violating the fundamental principles, stipulates and rule is corruption or personal favour.

The initial help for settlement can be provided by the government by analysing the skill people individually have to contribute the nation with. Desertification is identified to a serious problem in Sudan. Causes of desertification in Sahel:The impact of global warming and human activities are presented in the Sahel. In this area, the level of desertification is very high compared to other areas in the world.All areas situated in the eastern part of Africa (i.e. in the Sahel region) are characterized by a dry climate, hot temperatures, and low rainfall (300  ñ750 mm rainfall per year). So, droughts are the rule in the Sahel region. (Source - Wikipedia)The hot temperatures caused by the deposits of carbon caused by human activities can be diluted through converting the heat into electricity by the concept of thermoelectricity. It is more economical and powerful than solar power generation that converts light into electricity. How this works, let me put the concept in brief without elaborating much in detail as to keep this post as short as possible. Two different conducting wires are connected in series leaving the start and end point unconnected, the wires are chosen depending on their characteristics of thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. Let's call the connected series as cell. Most widely, the wires used are copper-iron combination or aluminum-iron combination. The output of former combination is less than the output from the later. The output will be more in an graphite-aluminum combination. One end of this cell is placed on a material that absorbs atmospheric heat, say a soap stone, black painted surface, concrete block or anything that could absorb heat. The other end is laid on an insulated surface, say a surface with heat resisting paint. The point is that both the end of cell must be placed on material that has a difference in its temperature for the cell to produce electricity. This set up when placed will generate electricity that can be stored in a battery that has an option to be connected to the house's main terminal. During colder times, households can use traditional means for electricity and during hotter times, we can use the atmospheric heat for energy generation. Its simple to solve the climate change, we needn't compromise the advantage enabled to us by technology.This would condition the environment for agriculture and slower the speed of desertification eventually putting it to stop.Where ever there is famine due to drought, this technology can be used to condition the environment. Places, where prosperity and progress are affected by climate change, can use this technology to gain back their natural environment. Agricultural activities would increase if this technology is used to stabilise the environment.Government through United Nations can seek help in stabilising the problems it's suffering with after which its the duty of government to help the people in enabling opportunities they need to meet their needs and establishing their living standards. Aiding money is not the solution, it dilutes the system without serving any purpose, Aiding opportunity is the best help that strengthens the system enabling it to progress purposefully. Poverty can just not be eradicated with financial grants. A nation will be with void if its approach towards poverty eradication is made through subsidy. No problem can be solved without addressing its cause. Covering the leak in a pipe with cloth will be a temporary solution, once the covering is taken pipe will still be leaking. So it's important that the government and citizens are oriented towards their responsibility, concentrating on making the nation productive through its forte of resources and skills than focusing on powers and economising of resources without including the people. To address the overlap between development and humanitarian nexus, the government needs to focus on the potential resource it has. Refugees, migration is not be considered as a problem but an aid for the region in its development. You aid them with resources they aid back development to you. Instead of idling them with surviving assistance, when we aid them with living assistance they add to the GDP  and progress of the nation. Development is itself in human welfare, we see it as a challenge because we see everything under the world as economy. When we see development as social progress that enables economic progress and humanitarian aid as enabling opportunities for the social progress, overlap will become interlink that solves the problem of poverty than being a challenge for poverty eradication efforts.

Democracy is the government of the people, by the people and for the people, here ""People"" is not a group of individuals clubbed together on a distinct common identity but every single individual person of the globe. There are several misinterpretations for which the world is suffering from so many conflicts, unrests, problem, inequalities and disaster. The world had been through different forms of government since its origin, at the beginning, it was band society, then it was tribal groups, civilisation, monarchy, kingdom, colonialism, democracy and now it's in the phase of global governance. Until colonialism, the governance was based on cultural, religious and social norm where people were ruled by the head for the decision of the leader or the king. Colonialism brought about the needed transformation with it that dissolved the structural societal hierarchy and included everyone through the system of common facilitation - It enabled education to all which prior was reserved for a specific social group, it enabled employment for all in every sphere which prior to it was structured where people worked only in the sphere assigned to their group. The natives couldn't foresee or see the help colonialism did to them and feared of being enslaved that they resisted to the changes and reformations of the colonial rule, this slowed down the pace of transformation. When resistance increased, focus got shifted from the reformation to suppress the resistance that ceased the purpose and progress. Natives fought for freedom and then came the period of democracy that set governance to a principled based form where people were governed for the fundamentals and by its principles. Since we forgot to realise this transition, the new form of governance was formed based on the precedence. By paper government is set for democratic principles, by outlook, the government is set on the works and frames of colonialism and by functioning, it was set on procedures of the precedence that we inferred from the form of governance previous to colonialism, ultimately, restricting democracy as just the people's right to vote. This clearly evinces the state of anarchy. We got stagnated at the same place, even after 65+ years of independence we are yet to realise what a democratic form of governance truly is but nature did not stop, it progressed and today the world is fully scoped with the environment needed to establish global governance. Actually, it should have been global governance from colonialism, but we took a small fall for our ignorance. Analysing the transition of government over the period of its evolution we can find that we had been through one complete cycle, Separate individuals formed a small group putting a start to the concept of governance through band society, then people with similar or cohesible living pattern and norm further grouped to form a slightly larger tribal groups, tribal groups with cohesible living pattern, norms and groups with skills serving the resources and works of the region grouped together to form civilisation, the same way civilisation grouped under monarchy, monarchic governance conquered places forming kingdom, then the division of groups largely united erasing their regional distinction through colonialism. The next eventuality should have been global governance where individuals would have been nurtured with the needed qualities through colonialism but for our ignorance and resistance we took a break that divided unified regions into independent nation and fortunately we were introduced with democracy that mandated the formation of new governance to be on and for the adopted fundamentals, else with the pattern we see now, we would have dramatically regressed aback with two forms, to monarchy. Civil unrest, internal conflict, the recent incident of the president refusing to pass on the responsibility to the elected president are all examples for this.Since, its the mindset of monarchy that is spread all through the world that is visible in some places and invisible in many, we are unable to make the progress in completing the cycle. The last part of the cycle, the global governance, is the phase where the world will again be independent individuals but this time they will be connected through the fundamentals of Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the constitution of the respective countries with their individual identity. It's this nurturance that the nations that got its freedom must have accomplished by now through democracy. As we did not realise the fundamentals, it's time that we pause, look into it, reform our functioning and activities in line with it so that we can progress ahead. Else, we will be moving backwards in the cycle to where we started despite the quality and quantity of efforts we take, current happenings around the world is an evidence for this.Fixing this issue is easy, we just need to reform the system that we have formulated on our misinterpretation and that the world is set to functioning for the principles adopted through the respective constitution and UDHR. Governance by its etymology is derived from the Greek word ""Kybernan"" which means to pilot or steer. Hence, Government is a part that steers or pilots the diverse personality and activities of its citizens and region towards the common goal of social progress and prosperity through the common principles adopted through its constitution and UDHR. Government is not about economising the resources of the region, the infrastructure of the region, its economic value, technological strength or possession, scientific growth or any of the illusionary factors that we are set with. Government is about providing needed facilities for all its citizens, individually, to nurture their individual personality to a productive form and orienting the same with the resources of the state for its social, economic and environmental progress.This is what is stated in Article 22 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ""Article 22.Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled torealization, through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with the organization and resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality.""Therefore, at first, we need to reform the concept of uniform facilitation that we have formulated our system with, then we need to reform the concept of average through which we formulated the uniform facilitation and then we need to reform the system's approach towards quality standards. Uniform facilitation and average facilitation curtails the totality of the world to a diminutive form belittling the actual possibilities of the world's progress and resources. This excludes the diverse expanse of resources and sources people have for their free development. Next is quality, by meaning, quality of systems nests in its adherence to its purpose. A system is said to be rich in quality, if its all of its activities conforms to the purpose of the system, enabling it to holistically progress in all spheres without any void or imbalance. The approach through which we set the system's quality as the conformity of the system to a set standard, excludes people who don't conform to it.What is the misinterpretation we have on Uniformity and how does it excludes people's resources and sources for free development? We have misinterpreted equality as uniformity. Through Independence when a concept of equality emerged and when it said everyone has equal right to opportunity what it meant was everyone in the globe have the just to claim the government with opportunities they need for their living and progress for their individuality that would enable them to contribute their best for the social, economic and environmental progress of the world. What we interpreted is that everyone has right to be hustled within the opportunity officiated by the government as the common routine which made it uniformity. If we carefully analyse, liberating the inclusion of all through right is thought as democracy, imposing opportunity as what is officiated by the government is autocracy, since both freedom and domination are without any guided principles it eventually ends up in anarchy, stagnating the world at its very place without any progress. The former that which included people enabling them with their freedom to design their living for their individuality through which they could enable social, economic and environmental progress is equality. Here, opportunities are free to people for what they are best at, the use of world's resources is ensured and assured to be productive, we orient the freedom (fundamental rights) enabled to people towards fulfilling their responsibility (fundamental duties). Here the participation of both the government and citizens is mutual and principled for the fundamentals adopted facilitating democracy and progressing the world to next stage (concentric) of the development cycle.What is the misinterpretation we have on average and how does it excludes people's resources and sources to development? We think and thought that setting the world to average will include everyone and will enable development for everyone but we forgot to realise that when 100% is development how could a system set for 50% enable holistic and equitable progress?  We statute the world with uniformity and inorder to facilitate all within the set statutes, we dilute the system with the concept of average. For example, let us take the concept of relative poverty. What is relative poverty? Relative poverty is when people do not enjoy a certain minimum level of living standards as compared to the rest of the population. How is this minimum level of living standard defined? It's through average. We illusionise poverty here, actually poverty is lack or inability of an individual to live up to his aspiration but with uniformity and average, we illusionise poverty as lack or inability of individuals to meet with a standard measure. Letting people to decide their life standards and enabling opportunities without limitations and stipulations for people to meet their aspirations in life is equality, it is democracy that ensures the process of development is set dynamic, progressing the environments of the world eternally. Stipulating a new definition within the scopes of officiation enabled is an absolute illusion that let us accomplish nothing in real and for reality. This further solidifies the existence of anarchism. Next is the misinterpretation the world has on the quality and how it excludes people.Quality is yet another measure of the system that's on illusion. The quality of a system by its meaning is the degree to which the system is holistic in it activities in meeting its purpose. The diverse approach within the system that's all anchored and oriented towards the set purpose and vision ensures nothing is left behind making the progress of the system complete without any void, this defines the quality of the system. Since we had already closed all other doors except the ones we had officiated the access through the concept of uniform facilitation qualifying and defining development at 50% through the concept of average standards, accomplishing quality for its purpose by enabling holistic and full development through the system is not possible. Therefore, what we did is,  we selected specific criteria as the systemäó»s quality from the stipulates we had set to the system to achieve the defined results. Now, quality is measured by the complexity of the system and defined as the cohesion of the system's functioning to the set procedures. For example, quality of education by it purpose is the facilitation of the system that enables everyone to be nurtured to their best for their individual skill and interest. Whereas, quality of education by our definition is the ability of the system to make all student individual enrolled in it to complete their course with the pass mark. We don't bother how if a school is able to produce all pass and if there are state toppers, it has quality. To maintain this quality, we filter individuals with their based on their ability to keep up with the stipulates of the system, affiliating our facilitation process to the äóìselection-rejectionäóù concept. We include individuals for facilitation based on their performance in an entrance or admission exam. If he/she is able to pass the exam with a good score substantiating their ability to survive the system, they are facilitated with the opportunity, while others are excluded. Complexity being a measure of quality is yet another place that forces people to exclusion. Already we have pulled back the prospects of the world to a great extent by homogenising its heterogenetic nature that set its resources and sources to exclusion. Now by including complexity, we further complicate the system making it hard and strenuous for people.  äóìAs you simplify your life, the laws of the universe will be simpler; solitude will not be solitude, poverty will not be poverty, nor weakness weakness.äóù - Henry David ThoreauHence, it is evident that the problem of poverty is, for the way we have formulated the world to function on our misinterpreted concepts. And it is also clear that poverty eradication is not possible in the current structure of the system as poverty is not just the state of inability of an individual to meet his basic needs (Absolute poverty) or the state of inability of an individual to match the average living standards of a region (Relative Poverty) but, poverty, in general, is inability of an individual to live upto his aspiration at any point of time in his life irrespective of his economic or material status and gains.To include everyone, leaving no one behind and to eradicate poverty it is important that we reform the system from the stipulations, restrictions and limitations its set with. Poverty cannot be eliminated by enabling subsidy with the tax collected from other, that's exaction. Both by morals and duties, its justified for government to liberalise the stipulates of the system in line with the adopted fundamentals enabling freedom to its citizens in designing a progressive and productive life for their individuality with the resources of the state than to enable them freebies and subsidy by taxing on the facilities and progress of the working individuals to the one who were excluded by the system for its stipulates and procedures. Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states,(1) Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit.(2) Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace.(3) Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.By this article, the government of all nations are mandated to enable education to all of its citizens that would enable them with full development of their personality, education should be free, general and equally accessible to all based on their merit.Here, again there are chances for us to misinterpret two terms, ""general"" and ""merit"". ""general' here doesn't mean uniform but it means education should be broad and specification free that would include everyone into the education spectrum for their individual personality, nurturing it to its best form where they can be instilled with the real principles of human rights. ""Merit"" here doesn't mean the grade scored or the ability endorsed in a certificate of merit that given for an individual substantiating through the common system but it means that educational opportunities should be for the individual personality of the individual, for the discipline or combinations of disciplines he/she is inherently best at through interest or inheritance. Merit of an individual is in his individuality that grants him his worth for this originality.Education shouldn't be restricted to learning through school. Government should include everyone with what they present as their knowledge or learning with due recognition. At first, United Nations University must reform the way it facilitates education, there is no point in United Nations owing a university or UNESCO affiliating with a university when all it has to offer is the same routine followed elsewhere in the world. UN to have a university add a purpose only when it functions to facilitates the principles it has adopted in its fundamentals. Autodidactism was duly recognised in the world before democracy. We had legends who learned for their self for their individual interest and contributed their best for the world's progress. But it's really unfortunate and strange that the world of democracy doesn't facilitate this freedom and restricts education to just school.Liberating the system will do no wrong, it will not hurt the world but it will heal the problems, inequalities and inequities existing in the world adding a fresh pulse and new life to the world. Article 23.(1) Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment.(2) Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work.(3) Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection.(4) Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.Article 24.Everyone has the right to rest and leisure, including reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay.Article 25.(1) Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.(2) Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. All children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall enjoy the same social protection.Same way, employment opportunities needn't just be for what the labour market enables. Jobs needs to be facilitated for the individual's need and not created for the market's need. The former ensures nation's wholesomeness whereas the later assures market's wholesomeness.Poverty eradication doesn't need money, it needs a government that includes its citizens for facilitation with designation or responsibility they design to serve the nation with their individuality. Accommodating refugee and migrants is not about keeping people idle inside shelters and enabling them with their living through aid. Shelters and aids to them can be for induction and once they settle, it's important to enable them to earn their own living through professing the skills and expertise they own. This would aid the country they have settled in terms of both economic and social development. Also, this would add to the development quotient of their native region as GNP. The focus for the future must be on how individuals could be included for progress and development through which the nation and the globe can multiply its economies and life standards. When our direct focus is on the economy and lifting up the life standards we tend to ignore the link that connects the resources and economies of the nation leaving development unequal and inequited.Considering all these facts it is clear and obvious that the solution to all problem is reforming our functioning in line with the adopted fundamentals liberating the system from all its illusions and setting it to be individual specific that includes, progresses and prospects prosperity for all individually and equally. ",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"While a lot of work has been done by a number of governments to eradicate poverty and leaving no one behind; their approach has not been very effective in targeting the genuine impoverished members of the community. The current approaches are mainly targeting the symptoms of poverty instead of the root causes of it. Policies should strive to empower and provide mechanisms to capacitate rural communities to be self reliant in providing for their basic needs by effectively utilising the economic base within their various communities. Instead of adopting 'a one size fit all approach', there is need to understand that the points of departure for various communities are different and require unique local solutions. These solutions can only come to fruition, by engaging directly the affected communities, not their 'spokesperson'. There is need for more grass-root approach in imparting fit-for-purpose skills and knowledge necessary to uplift their wellbeing.",1,2,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"Strategies for poverty reduction have to be global, and context specific. Percentage of resources going for reducing poverty has to be monitored. Is it adequate? How does it compare with global defense spending?  We need mechanisms like gender budgeting for poverty budgeting and expenditure analysis Coming from India wherein density of population and land is unequally distributed barring one or two provinces, it is important that resource distribution is monitored. In urban areas, the rich own 3-4 houses while there is no area for the poor to build- the are asked to live in resettlement far away from the city. There has to be a ceiling on houses in countries where density of population is high. Policies such as allowing non resident Indians to own houses in India have to be reconsidered. Right to house and land (rural areas) is important. Yet another issue is growth of agriculture. Except this year, the growth rate of agriculture has been poor, risk cover not available and terms of trade not in its favour.  This has to be addressed. Agriculture land is being converted for other purpose, one of the reason for which is low viability as well as demand for industries and real estate. Every country has to have a policy of how much land would be for agriculture, manufacturing and services.Last there are caste and gender specific reasons for poverty. Women are not able to convert education to employment due to gender bias (as well as general problem over supply of graduates).  Dalit women at times face caste discrimination at work. Safe transport, flexible working time and space, child care facilities at work space, safe work space free of harassment etc are a must. Women slip into poverty due to death of spouse, lack of assets on their name, domestic violence, desertion, divorce, polygamy etc Poverty reduction requires addressing symptoms, causes of poverty and processes by which poor slip into poverty.  Caste, gender, age disability, identity  etc specific reason for people slipping into poverty have to be addressed.",1,2,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"Development activities of a nation must be for the prospects it has. Since countries with developed status accomplished their progress through technology, science and infrastructure, it is not a mandate that development of all nations can be through the same means. It was possible for the nation to be successfully developed because its strength was its human resource that could be employed in technological, industrious and entrepreneurial activities relating to science and technology. Nations with developing status were able to partially succeed because their strength solely doesn't rely on human resources, their strength is in their natural resources, if their activities, trade and entrepreneurial ventures are oriented towards these natural resources, they can progress theirselves from the developing status to developed status. When our geographies are conducive for natural activities like agriculture, horticulture and livestock or animal husbandry, majority of our focus must be on it. Nations in the developing category are in the median that can focus its developmental ventures on both natural and technological activities. Whereas the nation that is in the LDC category must majorly rely on it natural wealth for its development. Its focus must largely be on activities relying on nature focusing very little on the technological side, to the amount of agricultural and natural activities carried out in the developed countries. This balances the spread of resources for life all around the world. So the arrangement of nature for the balanced and holistic functioning of the world is that regions nature rich geographies takes care of the living needs of the world, the regions with less natural wealth takes care of the technological and sophisticated needs of the world that eases the activities of labor or physical turmoil of the human community. The regions with both the wealth add up to the contributions of the both the regions advancing the world's resources to surplus that assures resource adequacy to facilitate all.When the world is big enough to accommodate such a huge number of population, how could it not have resources to facilitate all? The problem is that we don't see things beyond the rule or stipulated enabled to us. For agriculture, our source to water resource is just blinded to the river. We don't see any other means even if we have alternatives. The source of groundwater doesn't come to our mind, we don't mind to save rain water to increase groundwater table. Stubble burning was a practice followed where the leftovers after the harvest would be burned instead of ploughing it back to ground for decay. This actually benefits the yield and water retention capacity of the soil as the ash makes the soil porous increasing its capacity to retain water. When we see both the process of burning and decaying are same. Burning burns the dead or leftover immediately converted to carbon (ash) and carbon dioxide (emission) whereas in decay over a period of years and decades we convert the left over into carbon (coal) and carbon dioxide (emission). The coal is further combusted for and through human activities adding further amount of carbon-di-oxide. Since Co2 has heat trapping properties we have the problem of climate change. Now when this heat trapped in emitted co2 is converted into electricity through thermoelectricity, the balance can be easily accomplished. Even this concept of burning can be used to obtain the porosity of aquifers to reinflate the ground water table as aquifers are nothing but sedimentary or water-bearing layers that permeable for liquids and gases to pass through.We just fight for our right on resources without being responsible in enabling ourselves with the means we have to it.So the problem is not actually the resources but the restrictive approach we have towards sourcing it.  Article 17 of Universal Declaration of Human Rights says-(1) Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in association with others.(2) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property.Article 25.(1) Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.The government cannot impose restriction or control on the property owned by its people. whereas it can enable prosperity to all by including them with productive opportunities for their individuality that lets them own a standard of living they aspire with.Internet is one such boon for almost all the problems discussed here. Settling away from the city limits is a problem because of the distance one is expected to travel daily to access the amenities in city, education and workplace. Today we have online shopping and door step delivery of all amenities from food, groceries to medicine everything can be got at our doorstep. When we reform of system enabling everyone with a living standard adequate for their need and well-being settling in places away from city limits wouldn't be an issue.Likewise, enabling online platform for work and education would resolve the issue of a time-consuming journey from home to office and back home. It would also increase women's employment by enabling them work from home opportunity, when both parents are working from home they can mutually share household chores between them balancing their time for both their personal and professional life. Online paradigm sets workspace free of harassments.Enabling individual specific facilitation will prevent individual slipping into poverty due to unfortunate events.

What lessons have been learned with respect to understanding the social and geographical distribution of poverty in order to identify the poor and vulnerable within countries? A measure of multidimensional poverty based on the Alkire-Foster method, like the global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), can energise a coordinated, effective and multi-sectoral attack on poverty in all its dimensions.The MPI:Measures acute or moderate poverty in multiple overlapping dimensionsReveals the intensity of povertyProvides a clear, informative poverty headlineTracks change in poverty and its dimensionsEnables policy coordination across sectorsCan be disaggregated by groups and indicators to show success in leaving no one behindMay be mapped to environmental conditionsCompares non-monetary deprivations directly, independent of prices, inflation, or currencyThe Alkire-Foster method has been used to develop the global MPI, as well as to develop national MPI measures that reflect each country  »s local context and policy priorities. The methodology, developed by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), can be easily implemented. DisaggregationThe MPI and its component indicators, can be disaggregated by any group for which the data source is representative. Usually they are disaggregated by subnational regions, rural-urban areas, some social groups such as indigenous groups or ethnicity, and age cohorts.Disaggregation is critical because it enables us to identify the poorest groups so that targeted policy interventions can reach them, leaving no one behind. Studying disaggregated analyses over time shows whether these groups are being left behind or are catching up.  Monetary Poverty?Most countries of the world define poverty as a lack of money. Yet poor people themselves consider their experience of poverty much more broadly. A person who is poor can suffer from multiple disadvantages at the same time   ñ for example, they may have poor health or malnutrition, a lack of clean water or electricity, poor quality of work or limited schooling. Focusing on one factor alone, such as income, is not enough to capture the true reality of poverty.Comparing the levels and changes in income poverty and multidimensional poverty reveals a complex history, and reinforces the need to complement traditional monetary measures with a multidimensional approach.Africa, for example, has a smaller number of income poor people than multidimensional poor (388 million versus 544 million, respectively). This is because multidimensional poverty measures reveal aspects of poverty that can go unnoticed if we only consider income. See article here. MPI and the SDGsMany countries are using the MPI to measure progress towards the first SDG. Here are some reasons why:Leave No One Behind. MPI analysis tracks progress on poverty for different groups. Existing global MPI data allows us to see poverty by, for example, sub-national regions, by rural and urban areas, and by groups such as children, ethnic groups, and caste (ophi.org.uk)Monitor Progress. The MPI is used to track and compare multidimensional poverty over time. National MPIs are used to compare regions and groups within a country; A regional or global MPI can also compare countries.Integrated, coordinated policy. Whether in China or Colombia the MPI is used by senior policy makers to coordinate policy, and to understand and track the impact of their policies on the poor, helping to break down silos and intensify the impact of policy.Universal relevance. National and regional MPI measures are tailor-made. They address moderate or acute poverty and reflect contextual values and definitions.  The MPI can help eradicating all forms of poverty by illuminating for policy makers who is poor, how they are poor and how intensely they suffer poverty. Such detailed analysis will help to achieve a crucial aspiration for the global drive to end poverty: ensuring no one is left behind.",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"Well I see that thanks to Global's support, I'm now in business. Thanks again for the invitation and your support.LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND: I'll try to give you my rough ideas from an Argentinian background. I'm an industrial engineer, a long time trade and sustainable development consultant, member of the Centre of Education for Sustainable Development at Universidad Austral and have taught at other Argentine universities before. So I may have different, but I hope converging points of view. Even if Argentina's bread basket can feed many ""Argentinas"", we have around 30 percent of poverty in our country and between 5 to 6 percent people who are actually in dire straits. When the present administration took office on 10 December 2015 their key goal was -and has remained- ""zero poverty""; it is aligned with leaving no one behind. We have indeed the means. But Education is key. And this means educating the educators first. However, one of our top doctors in medicine, Facundo Manes, says that to eradicate poverty food, shelter and education are not actually enough. He says that while people who are poor are not able to see beyond the next day ""what will I put on the table tomorrow? Am I going to be able to pay the rent in two weeks time? What if I get sick and miss my pay? What if the wife gets sick?"" one cannot expect them to be able to think of a future, maybe not for him but at least for his children. If one cannot imagine some kind of future, says Dr. Facundo Manes, education will be lost on him. So Dr. Manes has joined, I can't say exactly in what capacity, an ad hoc team of the government of our most populated province, Buenos Aires. This team is integrated by doctors in medicine, psychiatrists, engineers, architects, teachers, in order to design a more comprehensive approach so as to ""leave no one behind"". This is what I remember of what he told us last year at the InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB) Annual Conference, held in Buenos Aires. I hope these  much abbreviated thoughts of Facundo Manes can contribute to our endeavour.",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"That is where the individual specific facilitation of opportunities principled through Universal Declaration of Human Rights has its role.Freeing the world from the uniform facilitation of average and common routine will include everyone for their individuality without stipulating what they do, how they do and what they get. This problem identified is because of the rule-based facilitation which we have framed by averaging the totality of the world, its scopes and setting the world's functioning on illusion. Reforming this rule-based facilitation and functioning to principle-based facilitation and functioning that includes the needs, demands and claims of people for their individual skill, expertise and ability by duly regulating it to progressive means could be a solid resolution to the problem stated. (The difference between rule-based approach and principle-based approach is that the rule-based approach enforces people to live within its officiations whereas the principle-based approach includes all progressive claims of people officiating it with due guidance and regulation) ",1,2,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"Many efforts are seen as eradicating poverty but most are leaving children, youth, disables and early young mothers behind.

Reading all of it thoroughly is close to impossible (time is our tyrant). I've read what Priya Prabhakar has to say with a great deal of attention. It is clearly not a question of improving averages, it a question of individuals, I do agree with you, Priya. Emmanuel points at empowering locally based organisations. This is very sensible indeed. In Argentina there is a huge net of small and medium size organisations covering a series of needs. These organisations involve voluntary work. Our Argentine society has many flaws. However, it is remarkable that solidarity is not among these flaws. The most interesting thing about these local voluntary organisations is that they run on limited but rather efficiently managed budgets. This leaves no room for corruption (as has been abundantly mentioned one of the top curses as far as aid is concerned). I may mention one I have been a contributor for many years, ""Manos Abiertas"" (Open Hands).The interesting thing is that, together with the other efficient locally based organisations, it combines food supply, good structured shelter and education. Education aimed at jobs that are accesible in their environment. For those in need, there is also spiritual and medical support. A wide net of individual supporters provide the monthly funds. I know not if all such organisations are as efficient, but the ones that make a difference are. In recent years ""Manos Abiertas"" was the example taken to create a foundation whose members and supporters are members of a club with a considerable number of club members and whose siege is the same district. This foundation has incorporated sport (football, hockey, rugby) into their programs. So, yes, Emmanuel you are quite right regarding local organisations.

I have enjoyed reading them all and have indeed learned a lot.Today, I wish to make a suggestion that in order to help mainstream SDG Goal # 1 and its accompanying targets it would be most helpful if a tool was developed/created to facilitate the review of extant and new government policies/initiatives (e.g., laws, programs, projects, foreign investment, etc.) akin to Bhutan's Gross National Happiness (GNH) Policy Screening Tool as well as Switzerland's Sustainability Assessment (SA) framework. Both of these tools are mentioned (on p.50) in the document entitled ""Mainstreaming the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Reference Guide to UN Country Teams"", prepared by the United Nations Development Group, February 2016 and posted recently by the moderators.The proposed anti-poverty screening/assessment tool would help policy makers identify systemic hurdles/challenges as well as enablers of anti-poverty initiatives by not only assessing existing government policies, etc., but by also proactively anticipating and highlighting measures that need rectifying or strengthening (i.e., if not done would undermine the attainment of Goal # 1).The proposal is predicated on several assumptions. First, I believe that adoption of the tool would highly depend on political will as implementing such a tool could potentially elicit resistance by some interests. Secondly, I believe that it is best to develop a tool for one SDG goal at a time for simplicity's sake as well as for buy-in by the disparate stakeholders. Lastly, for the tool to be successfully deployed/employed, good governance (including transparency and individual and institutional accountability) is very crucial.To be sure, this suggestion raises/begs the questions:(a) Who is to develop a prototype of such a tool that could then be adopted and adapted (mutatis mutandis) by governments around the world?(b) Who would champion the adoption of such a tool?(c) What lessons can we draw from the implementation of other extant tools; e.g., the ones in place in Bhutan and Switzerland alluded to earlier?

Programmes that target these people has the potential to address some barrier that make them more vulnerable to poverty.",1,2,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"Cecilia points rightly at why are some people poorer than others??? It is a very good question, Cecilia. And you give some hints in the right direction. Of course, it is still EDUCATION, especially at the primary and pre-primary level that has a strong influence on what you become later in life.We may be repeating some concepts already discussed among us these days. But it is part of this well organised brain-storming and it ought not to worry us too much if we tend to go back to some of the same issues.However, when one speaks of pre-primary and primary education, one needs to bear in mind that proper nutrition is esencial when one is targeting very small children. That is why, as I mentioned in an earlier comment, Dr. Facundo Manes has organised a team integrated by educators, doctors in medicine, psychoanalysts, the architects and engineers in the team dealing on shelter. I now  feel that some of the UN bodies might coordinate such teams of normally voluntary professionals.But here it is the team work that counts, and the integration of school dining-rooms that start with proper breakfast. The mind of a child cannot develop properly is under-fed. So says Manes. And we are all aware of this fact. So when Cecilia asks why are some people poorer than others? one should know how were they fed in their early years. In Argentina, first in the city of Buenos Aires, now on a wider geographical area, the free state education is including very young children. And the ""comedores escolares"" (school dining-rooms) are now one of the axes of pre-primary and primary education.I know that for some of you Argentina may look as if it were today situated at a higher level as far as this goal is concerned. Still, we have 30 percent of poor people in our ""bread-basket countryside"", especially in the non-rural areas around our capital city. Here politics and corruption have had a nefarious effect on the progress made as from the mid-50's. So our goal is still one which will require a great deal of coordinated effort. I refer to our cou,ntry Argentina, because this dialogue requires we have recourse to the cases we are familiar with. Not being actually an educator I may of course be putting these cases not in the proper manner, so, again, please bear with me.",1,3,3,1,3,2,1,0,0,1"The Brazilian crisis is in the international spotlight due to the recent events. However, the same ingredients are present in many countries. For example, in the Latin American region, much of the economic adjustment discourse has explicitly recommended a sharp reduction in social investment. It is the bitter price to pay in the present for achieving a prosperous future. However, little is said in terms of the price and the burden for the most vulnerable. For countries facing that scenario the challenge is how to introduce a comprehensive, integrated and inclusive agenda like the SDGs, while many governments are moving towards reducing their levels of social protection.The principles and the implicit public policy platform of the Agenda 2030 can operate as a normative reference for the debate on the economic crisis in the countries that are still fighting against recession or stagnation. It can be a moral reference for preventing regressive transitions in terms of social rights, well-being and equity.Brazil  »s Bolsa Familia has a strong international reputation as an effective conditional cash transfer programme. It has a significant influence in many a developing country. Once considered a fundamental feature of modern Brazil, today, during the worst political and economic crisis in decades, the future of the social protection system is becoming less certain. Powerful groups are calling for a reduction in social spending, questioning the generosity of the Brazilian social protection system, which increased consistently in the two previous governments led by the Workers Party.The programme has had many well-known successes. It has nearly eradicated extreme poverty and reduced inequality   ñresponsible for a reduction in the Gini coefficient from 0.571 (2014) to 0.517 (2015) and a 33% decline in extreme poverty in Brazil from 2004 to 2014 [1]. It also has important impacts on education and health, increasing attendance in school particularly for marginalized girls, reducing infant mortality. It is a powerful force for women  »s empowerment, over 93% of card holders are women and has specific benefits for pregnant and lactating women.The consistent decline in poverty and inequality is the result of a combination of economic growth and inclusive policies. The rise of employment (with a significant recruitment of low skill workers), the rise of the minimum wage (above the inflation) and the introduction of robust social assistance benefits produced the economic environment for the emergence of many. Other inclusive policies, such as incentives for poor and disadvantaged ethnic groups to access public and private undergraduate courses helped to elevate the possibilities to escape poverty.Among the many achievements of Brazil  »s social protection work, although perhaps less known, has also been its attention to data. Close monitoring of the programme has been a central tenant of programme delivery. The Cadastro Unico was created in 2001 to track socioeconomic data of low income families (with total monthly income up to 3 times minimum wage). It is a single registry database used to identify potential beneficiaries of Bolsa Familia and several other complementary programmes and it has been an essential feature for optimizing programme management. As the social programmes expanded across the country, extensive efforts were made to ensure all potential beneficiaries were reached   ñwith over 1200 crews visiting homes across the country and even trekking deep into the Amazon by canoe.Today, the Cadastro Unico is tracking the characteristics of over 26 million low income households, of which 14 million are beneficiaries of the Bolsa Familia. This database has been essential for optimizing programme management and monitoring implementation to ensure no one is left behind by the safety-net system. It has also enabled extensive monitoring and evaluation of the impacts of the Bolsa Familia and other programmes. With such rigourous studies that included millions of cases, it is more difficult to deny the results. However, it cannot prevent significant changes in the social protection model of Brazil. It can come as a collateral effect of the macroeconomic policies (for example: massive cuts on social expenditure) or as the direct intervention on the social protection systems   ñ for example: reducing coverage and the value of the cash transfer programmes.  The Cadastro Unico will help to monitor social protection programmes as an essential tool in Brazil  »s efforts to meet the Sustainable Development Goals. However it also offers an outstanding opportunity for Brazil to contribute to the SDG agenda. This database of 100 million people, with information regarding the implementation of 38 national programmes  provides the foundation for detailed evaluations of socio-economic impacts of policies and shocks at the household level over 16 years. It is a social scientist  »s data-source dream. And, it has become more openly available, becoming one of the powerful tools of the data revolution that will usher in a more sustainable future.Much of the data debate has so far focused on monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals, but big data can also be mobilized to simulate the direct impacts of alternative policy options to reduce poverty and inequality. For example, using microsimulation methods at the RIO+ Centre we have been exploring the effect of economic adjustments on the wellbeing of the poor population. Considering the persistence of the high levels of unemployment combined with the contraction of the social expenditure (reducing coverage and quality of the public provision of health and social assistance goods and services), RIO+ is testing the effect of the pervasive context on health indicators (under five years old mortality and morbidity, encompassing diseases related to poverty such as, malnutrition and diaorrhea). It also considered threats that more frequently affect vulnerable adult populations such as tuberculosis and violence. The primary question behind this work is if the favorable economic context combined with inclusive polices collapses what can be expected for the health of the population (and indicators for other SDGs) in the next 15 years?[1]PAES-SOUSA, R and CAMPOS, BP (2017).

From targeting corruption acts and making them accountable - brought to justice- to making laws for basic paperwork submission simpler for prospective students and job seekers. We need more laws of inclusion. For example, every school (public and private) and workplace must have a 30-50 % of participants being from minority groups such as woman, individuals of color, foreigners, etc. Another contributing policy making: a minimum decent six figure salary to every teacher at every public (and private) school. These policies will certainly ensure more diverse and inclusive societies. When considering the methods for measuring poverty such as Human Poverty Index (HPI) and Human Development Index (HDI), it is fair to state that most severe poverty exists within developing countries but there is evidence of poverty in every region, even developed ones.

Overpopulation-we can take measures to STOP the growth of the population, such as to legally limit the number of children per household to 2.2..Wars-everybody knows the devastating results of the conflicts world-wide and that , simply, we have to STOP them.3 Technological development, focused in only one direction.-koodos to the Human Species for its amazing Technological progress, BUT:      -while we can send flying for thousands of miles few tones of metal, we cannot stop effectively a Forest Fire, or predict an Earthquake, or deal with the floods or droughts.4. Monetary investments , focused in one direction.5. The Destruction of the Natural Environment, which is our HABITAT.This is the most important issue, if we are serious about ``not leaving nobody behind`` and alleviated the Poverty world-wide.What we can do:- start building back what was destroyed: the most important step is re-planting the Forests World-wide.-PLANT ; plant the Earth, by developing Technology capable to grow crop and food on the most sterile parcels of land, in the most hostile environments. The Governments should allocate such lands to each citizen, and the Developed World should provide the Technological assistance, so everybody will have a small piece of land, a personal GARDEN, and be able to provide his own food.-Invest in LARGE, much needed World Projects, such as BUILD A WORLD SYSTEM OF IRRIGATION, OR WATER- PIPELINES, able to transport the WATER in areas afflicted by Drought, or to chanell the FLOOD-WATER to areas afflicted by Drought.This kind of Project would employ hundreds of thousands of people, world-wide.-Due to our most recent developments in Technology, specifically the Artificial Intelligence, many people  will not have jobs, as the robots will replace the man-power. Well, these are good news:MANY CAPABLE PEOPLE WILL BE AVAILABLE TO WORK IN ENVIRONMENT.For the last century, we developed Technology and neglected the Environment; simply, we can MOVE TO WORK IN ENVIRONMENT, to use our technical development and our intelligence in this field.This is the way I see we can move up from World Poverty, but , as I suggested above, the Governments hold the power to take measures and make the change. If the Governments decide to not get involved in a real way, not only by talk, I am sure that any efforts in this matter will have very little results.I want to close by giving an example, about the Forests, and what happens when the Governments are just doing the talk; this example is from the two countries that I am citizen and live in :Canada and Romania.In Canada, the current environmental Government, left about 2500 square Km. of Forest to perish in fire, because the Prime Minister refused the help offered by other Governments to fight the Forest fire. So, also there are locally many Canadian Organizations concerned with the Protection of Forest, THIS ONE GOVERNMENT DECISION WAS MAJOR, RESULTING IN THE LOST OF A MAJOR PORTION OF FOREST- irreplaceable.In Romania, the destruction of Forests goes at speed, as most of the Romanian Forest id being sold for the money. Nothing would create such a level of Poverty in Romania, as will create this particular fact.With respect for your time, and with my understanding that the Poverty is a state in which a Human cannot provide for himself the basic, such as: food, water, cloths and a place to stay, or a ``nest` `.It takes place in super-developed cities and countries, and in the most remote communities.",1,2,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"FYI:  See report published by the United Nations Evaluation Group entitled,   ìEvaluating the Sustainable Development Goals of the    No One Left Behind  » Through the Lens of Equity-Focused and Gender-Responsive Evaluations.  ù   Also, see two reports by the Brookings Institution, USA.

What is not mentioned in the above opinions, is whether or not an individual wants a different life.  Poverty is not just geography or environmental or economic - it is cultural.  When you are talking about eradicating something you are eliminating a choice.  Some people choose to life a simple life, even if that involves suffering or doing without.  Has anyone asked these chosen people if they want change?  You can't just walk in and change thousands of years of culture.  What can be done, however, is education and tools that would make their lives easier a bit at a time.  Let there be some assimilation and acceptance of a different way of doing things.  Some people will be suspicious and sabotage the improvement effort; others will be fearful; others will be angry that you disrupted their culture and routine; yet some will accept or be open minded.  It's got to be a bit at a time.  After all you wouldn't want someone coming into your home and telling you how to run it, would you?  This is their home.If you want to make a difference, education is the key.  Time is a commodity these people have, irregardless of timelines set by the UN. Here in the US, there is a program that builds houses for specific families at no cost.  I remember a case where the house was built for a couple and two children.  They had been living in a car for several years.  After the house was built and furnished, the family moved in.  The case worker checked on them a week later and found them living in their car in the driveway, next to their new house.  The sheer size of that small house was overwhelming to them and they felt safer in the car.  In another case, a family moved in and a week later, when the case worker checked on them, they had made a fire pit in the middle of the floor and were burning everything wood to stay warm.  They didn't trust the electric heat.So, my point is no matter what good intentions you have, learned behavior and culture will take over.  We must educate first. ",1,2,3,1,2,2,1,0,0,1"Thanks for your suggestion but I think that when we are talking about eradicating Poverty, we are talking on that poverty that is not a choice! Children and Families in all part of the world that struggling to have something to eat and to find a job or a chance for their future.",1,1,3,1,2,0,1,0,0,1"Even though the concept has an alternative that thought behind it is valid and appreciable. Yes, we cannot and should not design facilities or living of others, that's a violation of the freedom entitled to them through the constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Culture is growth, culture is a concept that cultivates noble and wise lifestyle. Culture is in grooming an individual with principles of human and social values that lets him/her accept everyone for the skill and expertise they have to share with the world in its progress and to treat them with a spirit of brotherhood. Culture is not the set of rituals, customs or lifestyle that was assigned to a group in its earlier time. This is why the term for this concept was named as culture whose meaning by its etymology is ""to tend or cultivate"".  People can live a simple life but that cannot lessen or simplify the contribution they have to contribute the world in its progress. Suffering is neither destined to people nor evinces principled or truthful living. Suffering, hard work and toiling are all the factors that are dead against democracy and Human Rights. Also, the degree that defines simplicity differs from people to people and generation to generation. When a life puts its living being into suffering or hardship it is not simple life but a grieved life that is both undemocratic and inhumane.Definitely, education is the only key not just to eradicate poverty but all the social problems existing in the world at present. But it needs education to reform inline with its purpose. Education that merely encrypts formulas, derivation, calculations, theories and definitions of science and mathematics wouldn  »t bring in the change we intend, here education is just seen as a medium that builds an individual with his capacity to earn money getting himself fixed with the job markets enabled to all by the government or the facilitators. Education to serve as a key to eradicate the problems existing in the world, it needs to be individual specific. It should nurture every single individual of the world with the skills and interest the are innate to them in making them responsible citizens of the world in accessing the resources and prospects of the world through their individual personality.Government  »s basic and foremost duty is to include this individual specific design of living and functioning for facilitation through the social, economic and environmental resources of the nation by duly the regulating the design to correspond with the principles in the constitution and UDHR and orienting the design towards the duties of citizens principled in the same.On the other hand, government is not an administering unit but a governing unit. Government or governing is not about ensuring that the living and activities of all its populace are within the officiated means and framework. Administering is merely superintending whether the functioning are well within the border drawn by the system, whereas governing is to guide the functioning of the world by orienting the human capital with the resources of the state through the constitutional principles that assure everyone is included for progress and prosperity. The duty of the government is to help its citizen and be a guide to them in their endeavours. Sovereignty and eminence to the government are vested not to daunt, control or dominate its citizens and region but to include everyone in its facilitation for the individual specific needs of people  »s progress and prosperity by being citizen  »s guide giving them their self-worth, confidence and dignity in life. Its unfortunate and poignant for people to fear or feel suspicious on the government that  »s basic duty is to help them.Regarding the case study discussed here, this is why we need to enable opportunities to people than the facilities itself. When people  »s mindset is not in a way to adapt with the changes we are facilitating them, its goes purposeless, all the efforts, resources and time invested in it goes meaningless and futile. Elevating life standards must be through the living and individual nurturance of the people, their progress in life standards and prosperity must be for the progress they make in their life through their living.Directly enabling people with amenities for better life standards is like adding up to the elevation without building or strengthening the foundation which would temporarily hide the flaws leaving it to collapse within a short span of time.Instead of readily enabling the facility, when these families would have been enabled with opportunities to earn their living and life standards, they would have made it to their choice and comfort and by the time they had earned this facility for them, they would have nurtured due mindset and living pattern to fit this life standard.For people who expect a balance in their life before they could step out to contribute their skill and expertise, the government can include them with the opportunities of work they claim by advancing (loan) them the resources they need to set their individual or personal life at balance. By this, we ensure that everyone in the population are housed productive and the progress enabled to them are advantageous and utilitarian. This approach of advancing people is a better means to support people. When it is a freebie we exact the world and expect it to balance the resources invested to enable freebies, but when it is an advance, people who are enabled with opportunities balances it through their contribution to the world's progress.Therefore, we need to reform education to serve its purpose enabling every individual with free and full development of their individual personality that lets them contribute their best to the world through the progressive use of resources in enabling progress and prosperity to their self and the world. Meanwhile, the government needs to reform its functioning and approach in line with its purpose that facilitates it's people with the principles it had adopted through the constitution that mandates inclusion of all its citizen with opportunities for their individuality that doesn  »t restrict or limit their scopes within a shrunken paradigm.When our approach is not superficial, the change it would bring will be real and purposeful.",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"While I agree cultures must be respected and education is imperative in eradicating poverty, I hardly think most people would prefer to remain in impoverish conditions if they had an opportunity for a better life for their families. Particularly, for basic needs such as housing.  Many people from other countries have overcome surmountable challenges just to get to America for a better life. With respect to the program that build houses for specific families.  It sounds like you are referring to Habitat for Humanity.  My son and I once volunteered for Habitat building homes for families, and I can assure you there are many people who are very grateful for their new homes.  In fact, it would be great if more Habitats for Humanity existed worldwide.For the families you mentioned who had difficulty adjusting to their new homes,  it sounds like something else was going on that perhaps the Social Worker should have realized.

For example over staying in leadership have strong policies but are not followed so this has caused corruption in many countries especially in Africa and corruption is the major cause of poverty.SolutionAll stake holders should participate in the follow-up to the implementation of policies put in place; the stakeholders include civil society, private sectors, UN agencies, governments and individuals or concerned citizens in different countries and members of parliament in countries",1,1,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"I'd very much like to comment on something that has been less discussed hitherto. We have dealt with EDUCATION, which of course is vital, and withMEASUREMENT and DATA, without which we'd be navigating without a compass. However, the other essential element of SD has not been that much present. Three days ago Carmen Ghanim has dealt with the ENVIRONMENT. And yes, Carmen, how right you are!Of course, you may tell me that without EDUCATION there can be no concern as far as the ENVIRONMENT is concerned; right you are too. Sustainable Development must be tackled from its three axes. Carmen says: ""What can we do [about it]??? -Start building back what has been destroyed: THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP is that of re-planting Forests WORLD-WIDE!!!"" In our fertile Argentine country-side the last decade saw the destruction of native and planted forest areas in order to grow soy bean. Soy bean has been in great demand in order to be exported to China (it has nothing to do with feeding the local population nor our cattle). This destruction of forest areas is responsible for DESERTIFICATION. Desert areas, where forest stood, means what all deserts mean, plus huge clouds of dust generated where forests stood. Today the indiscriminate sowing of soy bean is being balanced by means of wheat crops and areas where cattle grow to produce the unique meat brand Argentina has been famous for. I'm far from being an expert in this field, so I ask my colleagues, especially my Argentine colleagues who may read this, to bear with me. But it is clear that without stopping forest destruction and switching to re-planting, there is NO FUTURE. For you all know that forests absorb part of the huge amount of tons of greenhouse gas emissions all our countries are generating every day. Of course, the oceans still absorb greenhouse gas emissions; but we all know how deeply the oceans have been affected! And to tackle these combined tasks efficiently, apart from an unrelenting struggle against corruption, EDUCATION must also point towards re-educating the government officials responsible, and those officials who are struggling towards leaving no one behind.",1,2,3,1,2,2,1,0,0,1"Education is imperative.  I would add, if the environment is not considered a priority and we become better stewards, over time, nothing else will matter.",1,1,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"first of all thanks to involve me in this important discussion. To eradicate poverty we need a comprehensive strategy in which governments, NGOs and companies are involved. We need to involve the companies to take care of the workers and the local communities where they have the plants. We need to measure the social impacts that a company and its products produce to the local communities and including in these social indicators the ones measuring positive and negative contributions on eradicating the poverty. In developed countries should be awarded those companies and products that produce a positive social contribution along its life cycle, and all indirect effects on increasing and reducing poverty should be considered, e.g. desertification, minimum wage and so on. We should make a campaign to rise the awareness of consumers to take care of this aspect when they buy a product.",1,1,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"I would like to address the first question of how policies need to be adjusted in different contexts, particularly regarding the role of co-operatives in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. My remarks are on behalf of the International Co-operative Alliance, a NGO in consultative status with the UN ECOSOC.Co-operatives are owned and democratically controlled by their members, that amount to more than 1 billion worldwide. They secure the livelihoods of more than 250 million people by providing decent jobs and/or being their main source of income. They are a powerful force in the economy of many countries with combined annual revenues of more than USD 2.5 trillion.Co-operatives are values-based and people-centered enterprises that can be major contributors to eradicating poverty, providing food security and decent employment, ensuring gender equality and women empowerment, protecting the environment and to implementing many other SDGs.The role of co-operatives is recognized recurrently by the UN and its agencies, including by the Committee on the Promotion and Advancement of Co-operatives (COPAC), a partnership between the International Co-operative Alliance, UN DESA, FAO, ILO and the World Farmers Organization.Examples of the work co-operatives are doing to advance the SDGs can be found in the online platform    Coops for 2030  » (www.coopsfor2030.coop).But despite this recognition and the evidence that exists about the added value that co-operatives bring, there is still much that needs to be done to explore the full potential of co-operatives, including by UN bodies and agencies. This is where we believe that policy needs to change.There should be a better recognition, active promotion and development of national co-operative movements so that they can provide a relevant balance to the investor-owned models of other private enterprises. National governments should prioritize the development of co-operatives to ensure that local communities have a tool to address their own needs and expectations. And, more importantly, to ensure that the wealth generated by economic activity remains in the communities where it is generated.In addition, national governments, UN bodies and agencies, and other development actors, should better integrate co-operatives in policy-making processes, delivery mechanisms and partnerships for sustainable development.We believe that the UN has an important role to play in making this happen and we are willing to discussion possible solutions and future initiatives.",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"I am sure that well educated and in to developmental activities during last several years are confused,because their two lines of  argument are[1]Education-vocational etc.We are witnessing this model in India.We are getting almost every year 2 to 4 million educated youth from Universities to high schools.The question is their employablity.[a]We are Trying-.Agriculture.2.Horticulture.3.Building works.4.Digital technology.5.Information Technology 6.Computer engineering.7.Public health.8.Smart cities.9.Highways.10.Ports.11 Health services and so on.But what we find is there are businessmen with either not aware of laws or not having Ethics as  to who is funding them-The people either directly or indirectly.The second 2...Is Free ration in the name of -""Policy reformation and right to development,Human rights"".I find this title in UN in India only.This shall be war torn countries where such experts can see  what exactly are human rights,and how to develop their rights and policies.Any functioning government has many functionalities which it needs to fulfill as per  the  sequential laws.And unfortunate such narrow titles do not fit for sustainable development.We can not make every thing free for ever and spoil generations.We need to give small training  and enhance their capacities to earn and live happily.In the process,we may accommodate certain up gradation -reservations-for enhancing their level of education-work-experience-earnings and so the status in society.I again repeat that we have 1 million strength in local circles where we discuss daily all issues from food certification,on line sales,vehicle certification,Rape,police action,law property etc,to quote a few,and submit reports to government to act.These also comes in news papers.Thus foundations for young generation as enterprenures and employment providers and for participatory democracy are solidly laid.",1,2,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"Sir, there is a continuous misunderstanding of the concepts and suggestions made. Where did I suggest ""free ration""? Yes, I understand that there are more than a million in local circles to discuss daily issues and submit reports to government to act, but my point is this democracy, is this independence, is this freedom or human rights for a group of expertise to decide what and how the nation to live with? Is it not that the same pattern of the royal court or monarchic form where retinue and courtiers of empire gather to discuss and submit advices for the government to act? What is the meaning of a world claiming democratic, free and liberal when it is the old routine followed as practice? How could we say this routine of the monarchy to solidly lay democracy?I never said everything to people should be free, indeed if my views are read without a retort this can be clearly seen and understood. All that I said was opportunities to progress must be free for people without any limitation or restriction.  And all that I ask is when democracy and human rights says people are free to full up gradation and everyone are assured with progressive opportunities they need to participate in the development of their self and the world, why do we force ourselves in-between to frame the world with a stipulated specification and later dilute and reserve it for few as a means for up-gradation, enhancement or development? When fundamentals sets the paradigm wide reserving diverse opportunities for all why do we shrink it to a smaller limit and reserve opportunities for few that put the world to exclusion twice?Would enabling free opportunities to progress spoil the generation or would enabling free facilities spoil the generation?Discussion must include people  »s perception, when a viewpoint is not acceptable, we are free to discuss upon the perception but not thrash the individual  »s contribution, that itself is a violation of rights. With authority, we take the power to hurt the self-worth, dignity and esteem of a being which by the fundamentals is entitled to them by birth. If anything is unacceptable, people are free to ask for a reason and conviction but cannot be judgmental and decide things to be useless, by doing so we are tightening the rope that pulling back the speed of development and progress of the world.This why research finding and concepts that could serve to resolves problems holistically are not proposed to the government or brought to its notice. Because we don  »t find the possibility of it serving the purpose but simply thrash people that would deprive their enthusiasm and life in total. This again is not new to the world and is existing from galileo's time. Wasn  »t heliocentrism true or real? Wasn  »t he called foolish and absurd, wasn  »t he abstained from furthering this principle, wasn  »t he pushed to deprived life for saying something that was in the thoughts of the majority? What did the world accomplish doing this? It just held the progress of this concept, its related findings and life of Galileo to stagnation. Today we have a world where many such expertise are kept invisible for the fear of being attacked or deprived. Where is democracy in here? I am not to point anyone in particular here, but to highlight the factor that is pulling back the progress and original richness of the world and that which is refraining from extending the people with a world true to its form.This absolutely examples why the world isn  »t democratic and rich in human rights. Mistakes are part and parcel of life, suppressing the freedom and progress of an individual by imposing guilt will not liberate the system to a higher paradigm, nobility of the government is in its ability to regulate the flaws and to balance the world progressively and its honour is in setting an environment that will scope to no negativity or deprivation. Democracy and independence is not autocracy by natives, its about freedom and liberty enabled to people within the scopes of its fundamentals in designing their life and living. People should not fear to express their thoughts and suggestion, they should not back away in the fear of being oppressed, they might have a point that will be more holistic in resolving an issue we face. This is freedom of expression.By impersonating the attributes of freedom and democracy to something thats not what it truly means, simply for the world to stick within what we have dwindled is distortion, we are misleading the world with illusionary factors .Ethics must be in the activity we do. Everything in the world doesn't start and end with money, finance or economy. It is a part which is enabled through the working of the world. Everyone in the world needs to be a humanitarian, their ethics should not to be the funding organisation but to the world and to humanity that will ensure the world to be progressive.I couldn  »t perceive as in what is tried to be conveyed through this statement  ìI am sure that well educated and in to developmental activities during last several years are confused,because their two lines of  argument are[1]Education-vocational etc.We are witnessing this model in India.We are getting almost every year 2 to 4 million educated youth from Universities to high schools.The question is their employablity.[a]We are Trying-.Agriculture.2.Horticulture.3.Building works.4.Digital technology.5.Information Technology 6.Computer engineering.7.Public health.8.Smart cities.9.Highways.10.Ports.11 Health services and so on.But what we find is there are businessmen with either not aware of laws or not having Ethics as  to who is funding them-The people either directly or indirectly.  ùIf this excerpt can be explained, it will be helpful for me to answer.

Human rights is about the freedom people have in this world that liberates them to a living for their individuality and a life standard to their ability making them through the resources of the state where they could fulfil all their responsibility. Human rights is about the scopes people have and the mandates government has in enabling high HDI. All my previous posts clearly explains this connectivity between human rights, development and HDI.Human rights is basic. Kindly refer to Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it would clearly enable us with a true cognisance of what is human rights. National human rights commission is already functioning in India. Democracy and human rights are synonymous and both of them correspond with each other by their principles of prioritising people with freedom. Human Rights is not a means of conflict resolution or political resolution, it is a means that set the world free of any conflicting or unresting scenarios. Human Rights should be understood, approached and practised as it is principled through Universal Declaration of Human Rights because it was UDHR that introduced the world with human rights.Eduction to avoid conflicts needs to focus on nurturing an individual into a holistic being than being a system that encrypts datas, formulas, theories, definitions and concepts of maths and science. India is still being in a developing status because our focus is too much scientific whereas the strength of the nation is largely in its natural wealth. India  »s geographies predominantly supports in activities thats nature oriented, formulating development policies that focused merely on the scientific and technological spectrum will not help India in crossing the border thats in-between developing and developed status.Your thoughts and opinion are welcomed but it can be imposed blindly, when you oppose something it needs to be justified as in why it is opposed? When people with  different thoughts discuss on a personal belief or liking, it needn  »t be focused to end on a unified thought or opinion but when it is about a public policy or a matter of general concern, it needs to focused towards bringing a unanimous conclusion, because, in a social spectrum, our individual specific work must be towards a unified goal and principle that will direct all our functioning towards the progress of the world in a progressive way. Otherwise half the populace will work towards and on a progressive principle, half would work towards and on a sustaining principles and the rest would work towards and on a restrictive principles one slashing on the progress of other making the entire world make no progress by nullfying the outcomes of one with the shortfall of other. Work of people can be diverse and different but the goal towards which they are work and the principle on which they work must be same for the world to gain progress by collecting the diverse progress enabled by the populace in each of its sectors.Discussion is to analyse and explore about a topic in detail, it needs to be concluded in a place that benefits the world at large.

While policies need to be implemented to take care of everyone within any given country they must also be adjusted to protect the vulnerable and marginalised, too often policies are developed in favour of the middle and upper class within society while the poor, people residing in economic disadvantaged rural and urban communities are left behind and when they do try to seek support to change their lived realities they experience red tapes and bureaucracy that they (the people) become frustrated and give up and remain powerless and weak.Policies must not show equality on paper they (the policies) must become the lived realities of those who live in and experience poverty each day of their lives. There is a high level of poverty in the Caribbean region, yet many times the Caribbean is overlooked, under researched, underfunded and many international organisations fail to take an in-depth look at the serious social and economic challenges of many families. A Caribbean country having a high GDP does not mean that there is economic divesification nor does it mean that there is state driven agenda for economic equality for the nations citizens. International organisations who look at a high National GDP for a country and reduces the aid or grants to such countries are perpetuating the continuation of poverty within such naiton states.How will policies need to be adjusted in different contexts to ensure that they more effectively contribute to leaving no one behind in the achievement of SDG1 and related SDGs?Policies need to look at the following:Establishing effective community development and giving the individual Boroughs or the local governments greater autonomy, increased budgets, increased staffing and the technical support needed to strategically develop communites as each Borough will have knowledge as to the extent of poverty and deprivation which they are faced with, there should also be a monitoring and evaluation department within each Borough and this department can be staffed with external and local persons including civil society members. Community development need to be seriously focused on beyond developing only the physical areas as there needs to be greater focus upon the people and assisting families to develop strong structures as many families live in powerless, socially, economically and academically deprived communities thus having no opportunites nor the motivation as they are socialised into helplessness due to their social strata.

The financial empowerment of women is a way forward to meeting the  2030 sustainable development goals, women's access to finances allows them to care for themselves and their families, it allows them to seek medical care to ehance their status of living and reduces the mental pressures of depression and anxiety.Access to quality health care services which are free, low cost, and allows for speed of access, availability of trained medical staff, medicine, and equipments which are functioning. Health care plays a crucial role in the life span of families and communities when adults are healthy mentally and physically then they are able to effectively provide for family members and help with motivating members to advance.Policies must look at the mental, physical, social, academic and economic areas of the individuals life as having comprehensive polices will allow that no one is left behind. Policies must also consider the socieconomic and cultural backgrounds of those they wish to serve, the diversed cultures and social norms which dominate. And a multidisciplinary approach must be adopted these approaches must include civil society organisation representatives who work on the ground as community members when combined make up the entire society and community members have increased faith in the civil society organisations on the ground as a relationship has been developed over the years oten times civil society organisations act as an individual, family and community first point of contact when a crises arise.Policies need to be specific, include evidence tracking and should have a social protection component, as social protection policies ensures that no one is left behaind. An education fund should be established for women and girls who have endured violence and abuse and are deserious of returning to school or have received an international scholarship. And Low cost housing loans should be established for persons below a certain annual income.Civil society organisations should be given greater support especially grass roots NGO's. They should be able to apply for social entrepreneurship loans which would allow the NGO to become self sustainable to offer a wider range of services, service more members within the community, maintain their present services without always having to turn to local, regional and international bodies for financial support. As when international organisations offer technical or financial support there is some level of bias and inequality. As the grassroots organisations who really work overtime on the ground are most times never funded.How effective are current methods for measuring poverty, in leaving no one behind? What lessons have been learned with respect to understanding the social and geographical distribution of poverty in order to identify the poor and vulnerable within countries? I believe the present methods may have been effective for the time span in which they were used or for the purposes for which they were created, however, with the rapid increase in the global population over the years the poverty continues to increase. This is due to a variety of factors of which social exclusion, economic inequality, and defective community development are contributing factors. Poverty data must not only come from government or state institutional agencies as this information can be skewed at times there must be a central agency which is independent of the state which captures data from the ground, from institututions, among civil society organisations and from the local government agencies inclusive of religious organisations. There must be a multipronged approach to capturing relevent data which can reflect a true representaiton of the issue of poverty but there must also be a monitoring and evident tracker to show progress and the reduction of poverty.   What are some innovative examples of employing data and the data revolution to identify and assess policy needs of those left behind?Employing Community based research where data can be captured from those who are actually experiencing the effects of poverty.Employing strategies to accurately give support to the deserving poor as many times the undeserving poor or persons who exploit social services are counted as deserving poor and this can restrict support from reaching the deserving poor as the undeserving poor may be in the majority. Developing a strategic approach or program to equitably meet the needs of the deserving poor.Look at the stereotypes which may be hindering the accurate documentation of data, if discrimination has led to services not being offered to the deserving poor in the first place, then consultation or data collection may reinforce this discrimination by asking only those people who have received the service. ",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"Data is crucial and new tools as the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) are an important source of information to guide policy to leaving no one behind. Several countries are using their National MPI as a tool of policy coordination across sectors, programmes, and levels of government. The MPI is used to align government instruments (budget allocation, targeting, programme and policy design, and so on) with the aim to reduce poverty in all its dimensions.For example in Colombia  »s Roundtable, the MPI level and deprivations of the poor in its component indicators are considered at the national level at a meeting of ministers from relevant sectors, chaired by the President. Ministers deliberately coordinate policies several times a year in order to reduce the deprivations included in the MPI. This is a good example of multi-sectoral, integrated policy development.For more information click here: http://www.mppn.org/national-roundtable-colombia/Another case is Costa Rica, where the Government will prepare its national budget and allocation of resources among several programmes based on MPI figures. More info here (in Spanish).Similarly, in Chile, they are using the MPI to create public policies on housing taking into account some of the MPI indicators. See interview.In Mexico, the Government at different levels is using the national multidimensional poverty measure to inform policy making. As the Executive Director of Consejo Nacional de Evaluacií_n de la Polí_tica de Desarrollo Social (Coneval) says in an interview:   ìSocial policy has focused in the multidimensional poverty indicator.  ù",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"1) instead of looking at this from a broad scale, how about choosing a village or tribe, or small community and use them as the test group?  Try the theories, explore, question.  Maybe if it works with that community, the plan will work on a larger scale.  (Taking into consideration that poverty thinking is different in the US vs Russia, vs Rowanda.)  My example would be the US Affordable Care Act.  It failed because they did not use a test area, like a small town/small community to find the weak spots.  The government simply released it nationwide with devastating results for some communities.2) It seems that this discussion is concerning ""individuals"" but with group think.  Not all ""individuals"" want this help.  It's a human condition for some to not want what is good for them. (Otherwise everyone would go to college...?)  What do you do with the dissenters?Just a thought....",1,2,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"The answer to your first question is in your second question and the answer to your second question is in the last part of your first question.Grouped and uniform facilitation is not going to serve any purpose be it a group of large scale or small scale. Every single individual is counted for the development of the nation and world, their constitution in the world  »s wholesomeness is manifesting and significant. Only when every single being are facilitated with opportunities to progress and prosper to their best, the development of the world can be said holistic.Therefore,(i) Facilitation needs to be individual specific and not group specific because not even the twin with identical outlook carry same interest, skill, and combinations of both. Even if they are interested in the same field their interest with the field and approach towards a concept will vary, they cannot be 100% identical, in this case how could we expect our uniform facilitation for a group, be it a smaller group or a larger group, to facilitate all within the group. With minor adjustments it would accommodate majority in that group leaving a few unaccomodated, so there eventually we have exclusion or curtailment happening twice, (a) when people adjust to fit within it (b) few who weren  »t able to fit themselves with the facilitation. So, this leaves behind some and to ensure that this populace left behind doesn  »t stay there, we introduce concession and special reservations for them to parallel the majority who got included into our facilitation, this negates the system  »s adherence to the principle on which the facilitation is formed. Now, why do we first stipulate and then dilute it making it unfair for the populace who substantiated themselves through these limitations and stipulates with hardships? Instead why don't we free and liberate opportunities at the beginning to all that lets everyone to take up opportunities that lets them to contribute their best to the world. Wouldn  »t cumulating best of all citizens allow the nation and world to accomplish besets development?(ii) Second, is facilitation needs to be diverse or heterogenic and not uniform or homogenous. Choosing one specific method to source of resources and one specific method to facilitate opportunities ties down the freedom of choice and the best possibilities of the world to minimum excluding (leaving behind) the variance of choices and possibilities originally enabled by the world. This leaves behind the scopes and choices available for the concerned individual to bring out and contribute their best. This again averages the leaps of development basically possible.Than subsidising medicare expenses, wouldn  »t enabling all citizens prosperity that is adequate to their well-being, life standards, emergencies, and securities help them to take care of themselves. Wouldn  »t liberating the system and opportunities from the stipulates and restrictive framework include all in earning themselves with all their needs? This would be more progressive than getting subsidised medicare, because even there, there a number of if  »s, then  »s and only  »s. The answer to the second question is, going college is not the only way of goodness or access people have for education, when government recognises the knowledge and nurturance of people without stipulating their learning to be through the set system at educational institute, that is goodness and will have no objectors or dissenters Individuals want help but they may not want it in the way its stipulated for facilitation.Do we have everyone who passed the educational system settled in their life? Are the knowledge and skills taught through the systems directly fits the needs and demands of employment system? We hire graduates, incubate them for a period of time as probationers, teach them the practical world and employ them into the regular stream. When the system doesn  »t ensure 100% employability what is the use of making up the data to 100% education by hustling everyone into schools, college and universities? When the system doesn  »t prepare students to 100% fit the world outside why are we confining our officiation just to it?The answer for the both the question is that opportunities need to be individual specific, facilitated individually to all in the populace. Government should take care of the means people have to earn their living and facilities that will make the nation holistically productive and not grant facilities for free or as subsidy that will make them idle and get detached from their responsibility and from system, exacting more from the populace that is productive, burdening all the responsibilities of idled populace on to them to keep the world balanced.Hope this helps...",1,2,2,1,1,0,1,0,0,1"Housing co-operatives can play a big part in the SDGs. They can help end poverty and hunger by providing safe, affordable and stable homes from which a mutual and lasting economic base can be developed. Moving from informal settlements into sustainable co-operative housing provides a base from which to build access to good sanitation, health services and education. The values and principles of the co-operative movement provide the moral, ethical leadership needed for peace and justice to prevail, for economic and gender equality, and for our stewardship of the planet, taking from it only what is needed for a decent quality of life for all.As a visible presence in their local communities, housing co-ops are well positioned to be community leaders on these vital long-term goals.

In the last decades the recognition that long-term sustainable poverty reduction starts with children and that it is not possible to reach developments goals without including children has increased. In this context, there is a need to create measures to analyse the levels of multidimensional poverty of children in different age groups, recognising their differences and also that children are affected by the characteristics of their parents and other family members.Based on Alkire-Foster multidimensional poverty measures, like the MPI, there are at least two possible approaches to analyse child multidimensional poverty. First, national MPIs, can be age-decomposed to show the proportion of children that live in poor households and the profile of deprivations that their households experience. Second, it is possible to develop a child-specific multidimensional poverty measure that captures the unique attributes of child poverty, including age-specific children deprivations that are usually ignored in household multidimensional poverty.Both types of analyses provide important information for policy makers. The first provides information related to the deprivations experience by poor households with children; the second allows us to identify specific priorities for different age groups. Measures based on the methodology Alkire Foster are important tools to describe the levels of multidimensional poverty of children and their families; to monitor social policies aiming to reduce deprivations of children and improve their opportunities and to prioritize action to cover the needs of children and their families.",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"Leaving No One Behind: Making Fraternity Universally EffectivePoverty is very vague term; deliberation and intellectual discussion are taking place on large scale since last 1990's. Many intellectuals define poverty with different dimension may it be in tune with economic, social and nutritional dimension. In connection with current discussion, ""Leaving no One Behind"", what I feel Poverty is, ""deprivation of someone, to live life with dignity"".  To this notion poverty is there in some and other form in human society since its inception and it has been deepen with emergence of modern form of conjoined society and worsen by intricate technological advancement.So to arrive at the state where there is no one with poverty, we require focusing on complex functioning, characters and attributes of the societies.  In Buddha and His Dhamma, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar the father of Indian constitution quoted that,   ìit is common knowledge that evolution takes place through a struggle for existences because the means of food supply in early times were so limited  ù. The struggle is bitter. Nature is said to be red in claw and tooth. In this struggle which is bitter and bloody only the fittest survive. Such is the original state of society, even today may be means for leaving supplanted with many other element apart from foods such as education, health, access to technology, information and assets for smooth leaving, sharing in social decision making (resources) and so forth.Question arises what makes someone fittest and someone weakest (poor) individual - it is off course isolation, exclusiveness, fortification of own group interest, which is antisocial and lead to disorganised and factional society.  Factional state of society comes up with number of different models and standard with resultant of disharmonious society and non-consistency of mind. In such situation individuals with resources accession (fittest) relish       supremacy over others (weakest) irrespective of its rational claims inevitably leads to conflicts and gave birth to poverty.In the course of ancient past and in current milieu, someone must have raised the question, is the fittest (the strongest) the best? Would not the weakest if protected be ultimately the best for advancing the ends and aims of society (here weakest is person with poverty)?Then comes, the question what is the way to protect the weak? The simple but toughest way is to impose some restraints upon the fittest. Restraints in terms of making compulsion (here comes the origin and necessity for morality) for   the fittest to work for betterment of weakest   ñ this demand for resource distribution for the poor  »s of the society. This morality had to be sacred because it was imposed originally on the fittest, i.e., the strongest.One of the important dynamics that intellectuals often forgo while framing the policy for poverty eradication is consideration of fraternity. As in struggle of existence the interest of groups, caste, class, creed, sect and religions are protected and so the individual interest and in that poor  »s of the society are not safe. These in turn percolate the discrimination and denial of justice more severely for those who lack resources for substance to live life with dignity. Thus better off remain better while those who are born poor remain poor. Consequently there emerges the situation where liberty for well-being remains for some and not for all.Accordingly if we want the world with   ìleaving no one behind  ù we need to work on priority basis for Making Fraternity Universally Effective strenuously along with common rule of morality with relevant common models and ideals.   _  _  _",1,2,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"True, poverty is ""deprivation of life with dignity"". But does it really rise from the world being globalised and for the advancement of technology or is it for the facilitations we have that doesn't adapt the advancements of technology in enabling the ease and connectivity enabled by the globalised world?Thank you for highlighting the book of Dr.B.R.Ambedkar and the excerpt from the book. This excerpt quoted from the book along with the entire content of the book supports the principles of the Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that facilitations need to be individual specific. Let's start analysing the content from the excerpt made,   ìIt is common knowledge that evolution takes place through a struggle for existence, because the means of food supply in early times were so limited. The struggle is bitter. Nature is said to be red in claw and tooth. In this struggle, which is bitter and bloody, only the fittest survive. Such is the original state of society.  ùThese words where to explain why principles is scared and why it should be violated or questioned. Its an excerpt from the subtitle that explains mere morality    principles  » is not enough but it needs to scared and universal, that is principles to which we anchor our living and functioning must include all, it must not be restricted or constrained within a region or religion specific morality but it must based on universal morality that must be accepted without violations.The above excerpted text was to explain why morality    Principles  ù made sacred. Let us look into the content of this subtitle in full that will enable us better understanding as in why we need to stick to Constitution and Universal declaration of Human Rights, the basic principles set,(i) to government in its functioning and facilitation, and (ii) to the people in its living and functioning. In the book, it is said that there are three parts to have played its role in making morality sacred,(i) the social need for protecting the best(ii) the way to protect the weak without constraining the strong, to protect social from becoming anti-social(iii) to safeguard the growth of individual. i. Excerpt that deals with the social need of protecting the best:  ìwhy morality should [=should morality] have been made sacred? Three factors seem to have played their part in making morality sacred.The first factor is the social need for protecting the best. The background of this question lies imbedded in what is called the struggle of existence and the survival of the fittest. This arises out of the theory of evolution. It is common knowledge that evolution takes place through a struggle for existence, because the means of food supply in early times were so limited. The struggle is bitter. Nature is said to be red in claw and tooth. In this struggle, which is bitter and bloody, only the fittest survive. Such is the original state of society.  ùThis excerpt explains that we need to protect and adapt to the changes and betterment we have accomplished through the evolution and not to stick to the old or precedence. Morality is in protecting and promoting the best and not in restricting or constraining ourselves to the old. Survival of the fittest was the concept of living and facilitation when the world had limited resources for living.The fact is nature was really not red in claw and tooth but the ignorance and restriction that we had in accessing and use of resource made usto feel nature as red in claw and tooth. It was the resources and abundance of nature that supported in the origin of everything in and under the world, its our ignorance, the constraints and limitation it bought to us that was    red in claw and tooth  » but not the nature in reality.Without cognising the real and full scope of betterment and ease of life we have for the advancements we have accomplished through evolution is an act of making the world red in claw and tooth because we ignore the possibility and restrict the living of the world to a shrunken environment for and with our authority that puts them to pressures, bombardments to secure a place for them within the limited space making the world remain barbarous. Therefore, we need to liberate the limitations and restriction we have set the world through our design that it makes the world live with its morality. ii. Excerpt that deals about protecting social from becoming anti-social:  ìIn the course of [the] ancient past someone must have raised the question, is the fittest (the strongest) the best? Would not the weakest, if protected, be ultimately the best for advancing the ends and aims of society? The then prevailing state of society seems to have given an answer in the affirmative. Then comes, the question what is the way to protect the weak? Nothing less than to impose some restraints upon the fittest. In this lies the origin and necessity for morality. This morality had to be sacred, because it was imposed originally on the fittest, i.e., the strongest. This has very serious consequences. First, does morality in becoming social become anti-social? It is not that there is no morality among thieves. There is morality among businessmen. There is morality among fellow castemen and there is also morality among a gang of robbers. But this morality is marked by isolation and exclusiveness. It is a morality to protect ""group interest."" It is therefore anti-social. It is the isolation and exclusiveness of this kind of morality which throws its anti-social spirit in[to] relief. The same is true where a group observes morality because it has interests of its own to protect. The results of this group organisation of society are far-reaching. If society continues to consist of anti-social groups, society will remain a disorganised and a factional society. The danger of a disorganised and factional state of society is that it sets up a number of different models and standards. In the absence of common models and common standards, society cannot be a harmonious whole, With such different models and standards, it is impossible for the individual to attain consistency of mind. A society which rests upon the supremacy of one group over another, irrespective of its rational or proportionate claims, inevitably leads to conflict. The only way to put a stop to conflict is to have common rules of morality which are sacred to all.  ùThis part of the content explains how elevating the weakest or the excluded can be done to just and morale. Grabbing the accomplishments or snatching what they have added to them as savings or earnings to balance the weakest. That isn  »t social but anti-social. Morality or principle is not the group specific or interest specific guidelines that demarcates and differentiates populace discriminating each other. iii. Excerpt that deals about safeguarding the growth of individuals:""There is the third factor which requires morality to be made sacred and universal. It is to safeguard the growth of the individual. Under the struggle for existence or under group rule the interests of the individuals are not safe. The group set-up prevents an individual from acquiring consistency of mind, which is possible only when society has common ideals, common models. His thoughts are led astray, and this creates a mind whose seeing unity is forced and distorted. Secondly, the group set-up leads to discrimination and denial of justice. The group set-up leads to stratification of classes. Those who are masters remain masters, and those who are born in slavery remain slaves. Owners remain owners, and workers remain workers. The privileged remain privileged, and the serfs remain serfs. This means that there can be liberty for some, but not for all. This  means that there can be equality for a few, but none for the majority. What is the remedy? The only remedy lies in making fraternity universally effective. What is fraternity? It is nothing but another name for [the] brotherhood of men--which is another name for morality. This is why the Buddha preached that Dhamma is morality; and as Dhamma is sacred, so is morality.  ù This part explains why the worlds needs to be individual specific and set on a broader spectrum that includes all for their individuality. In a group format, people within the group who are governed by a head and for a group specific principle are forced to abide to the ruling of the head and for the group specific principle to fit within the group and get facilitated with what it facilitates, it doesn  »t enable any wisdom, learning or experience to the individual, it doesn  »t allow an individual to prepare and bring his mind to a balance that is needed for a human individual to be holistic and responsible in life. What is universally valid can only be morality or principle, an entity that fits to all and includes all is morality, anything that stipulates, restricts, limits freedom enabled to people within this principled fundamentals or that alters the universality of this principles to group specific, is anti-social. We cannot manipulate something to our convenience, when the fundamental morality of the government says every individual is free to take up opportunities through the resources of the state for their individuality to enable progress and prosperity to their self and the world, we cannot manipulate the freedom forming groups, majority and minority. In democracy, constitution and to the globalisation, Universal Declaration of Human Rights are their respective dhamma.""Religion, it is said, is personal, and one must keep it to oneself. One must not let it play its part in public life. Contrary to this, Dhamma is social. It is fundamentally and essentially so. Dhamma is righteousness, which means right relations between man and man in all spheres of life. From this it is evident that one man, if he is alone, does not need Dhamma. But when there are two men living in relation to each other, they must find a place for Dhamma whether they like it or not. Neither can escape it. In other words. Society cannot do without Dhamma. Society has to choose one of the three alternatives. Society may choose not to have any Dhamma as an instrument of Government.  For Dhamma is nothing if it is not an instrument of Government. This means Society chooses the road to anarchy. Secondly, Society may choose the police--i.e., dictatorship--as an instrument of Government. Thirdly, Society may choose Dhamma, plus the Magistrate wherever people fail to observe the Dhamma. In anarchy and dictatorship liberty is lost. Only in the third [case] liberty survives. Those who want liberty must therefore have Dhamma. Now what is Dhamma? and why is Dhamma necessary?  According to the Buddha, Dhamma consists of Prajna and Karuna. What is Prajna? And why Prajna? Prajna is understanding. The Buddha made Prajna one of the two corner-stones of His Dhamma because he did not wish to leave any room for superstition. What is Karuna? And why Karuna? Karuna is love. Because without it, Society can neither live nor grow; that is why the Buddha made it the second corner-stone of His Dhamma. Such is the definition of the Buddha's Dhamma."" This excerpt says how is dharma different from religion and why is dharma important in a society. Here, it is said that the society may choose to be in three forms,Not to have any dharma as an instrument of government. By this society chooses to be in anarchy as for dharma is nothing if it is not an instrument of government and so is to the government.Society may choose police - dictatorship as an instrument of government. It may choose policing, controlling, punishing population to be within the boundary line it has drawn Society may choose dhamma plus the magistrate  wherever people fail to observe the dhamma. Here we don't punish, deprive or torture people who don  »t conform to dhamma, but counsel, teach and regulate them to observe the principles when they fail to observe the morality.So, the first two form is not democratic, it doesn  »t facilitate liberty to people whereas the third form of society will include everyone to progress and prosperity enabling them with responsible liberty. This is what is also principled through the Constitution and Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Having the world set to the second form of society with anti-social specifications, we cannot expect fraternity or brotherhood to spread. There can only be evils, problems, inequality and calamity as the system we have setup doesn  »t facilitates or conforms to the factors it is expected to facilitate and abide to. Unfortunately, if we could analyse, we can find the society or the world at present is set on the first two format of society described above.Principles of Constitution has to facilitated as it is, it cannot be modified, tuned or tailored for the convenience and misconception of the world. When it says every individual has the liberty to design their living and progress for the common principle of social and human progress, we cannot tailor it uniformly for a group in specific to their interest that takes away the space and scopes of individual liberty enabled to all in the global populace.",1,1,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"I feel it might be about time we begin drawing some, at least some, initial conclusions from this very rich discussion. Let me do some ""mind-storming"",we might then do some brain-storming too, if you so wish. So don't expect order in what follows, please.There are so many constraints one cannot expect to do a perfect job;However, as they say in China, every undertaking, even a huge undertaking as ours, begins with the first step;And this discussion shows clearly that conditions vary from region to region, from country to country and even within countries themselves;Bases from which to start are very different; so the goals each region/country set cannot be identical goals, or the time horizon, number of steps and approach are bound to differ;Culture, religion, history, politics, economics, races, social levels & their inter-connection, all these elements are different. As many of you have pointed out, they do have a considerable bearing in our present levels of poverty and thus will define the actual launching platform and how to plan regarding the goals to be attained;Many of you have pointed at corruption and how corruption dilutes and distorts aid; so the manner in which aid is channelled must be carefully adapted, which will required a great deal of diplomacy, but which will make the difference between effective and non-effective aid. The poorer the country, the most important this consideration, which  is something I feel must be faced bluntly;The differences you have discussed will mean one shall need to coordinate education-health-shelter-education of the educators-aid in different ways, with regard to regions, countries, districts within countries;I feel each one of you is able to think of ways of tackling our goal or goals (in fact you have addressed most of these ways through your fertile comments).I have just tried to see whether we can begin to work on  some tentative conclusions.

These are values that inspired the United Nations  » charter, and now, at this defining moment in human history, they must become the foundation of our actions moving forward.I represent the Legion of Good Will, LGW (Legií£o da Boa Vontade, LBV), a Brazilian originated civil society organization dedicated to promoting educational and social assistance programs to help reduce poverty and social inequalities in 150 communities across seven countries: Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, Portugal and in the United States.Throughout 67 years of experience, we have learned that the most effective method in overcoming poverty is through a holistic approach that addresses the diverse needs of individuals- the biological, psychological, social and spiritual dimensions.Our outcomes prove that it is as equally important to provide essential social services and quality education as it is to restore hope, human dignity, and develop a higher consciousness towards a solidary, altruistic and ecumenical society.In the past five years, more than 1.7 million people were positively impacted by the Legion of Good Will  »s work. Even in the most vulnerable communities, we have found effective outcomes such as high levels of increased academic performance and social mobility.For this reason, we believe that it is vital to strengthen Education for a Global Citizenship, because this focus empowers people, who can rise to the challenges facing the 21st century.  We invite all to read our recommendations in the Good Will magazine (available online at: http://www.boavontade.com/sites/default/files/content-type-documents/bv  _), where we share our best practices in implementing Education, Sustainability, and Global Citizenship as levers for sustainable development.

While that sounds incredibly easy, it is in fact not, as ""leaving no one behind"" is the true challenge, as most contributors figured out correctly.After working with minorities, partly and completely unrecognized nations and ""muted communities"" for a couple of years now, I feel qualified enough to criticize a few approaches and to give my vision for improvement:While the United Nations say and claim that they do not want to ""leave anyone behind"", they still do so. I have been on the ground in Nagorno-Karabakh, in Abkhazia, in Transnistria and in South Ossetia lately. The only UN staff I saw in those highly vulnerable and suffering regions was ""stationed"" in Abkhazia. In fact, he was based in Tbilisi and was also ""working on Abkhazia"" to eradicate poverty in the region. However, he was not allowed to cooperate or even speak with the ""local authorities"" in any way, which led to a complete inability to seriously do anything on the ground. It was not me observing that, but that very UN worker, who complained about the diplomatic dilemmas that forbids him to do anything or even observe anything. He was left with no option, but sipping cocktails at the seaside for a day, before returning to Tbilisi.As mentioned above, this was the only UN staff I ever met in a non-recognized country (except for Kosovo, where I met plenty). I understand the diplomatic reasons for the limited work there very well, but still it completely ignores the fact that in such regions there are many suffering poor people, who are completely left behind for a simple reason: The bigger political game, on which the civil society in none of the mentioned ""states"" has any effect. Even worse, that blockade is leaving the people and their ""authorities"" with no option, but looking for other options for help, a fact the whole world mourns about afterwards. And surely, those other options are looking for anything else, but for ""humanitarian reasons"" at such ""states"".If the UN is serious about ""leaving no one behind"" it must become ""apolitical"" in humanitarian missions and must do all it can to help those who suffer!In other surroundings I constantly work, people are left behind, because they belong to some kind of minority: Some indigenous group, some linguistic or ethnic minority or any other discriminated group of individuals. In all those cases humanitarian aid is given to stately entities that do not distribute it to the ""unliked"" communities, but rather keep it for the majority. This problem is seen everywhere on our planet and is also well-measured by plenty of NGOs and the United Nations itself in several studies.There is no easy answer to overcome that issue, but I strongly believe in the ""education is the way out of poverty"" rule. That said, I think that teaching minorities groups in English and educate them in basic things in English can be a first step towards a better future. With a profound knowledge in English and a computer with internet access, the knowledge of the world can be yours today. Secondary, that alone will enable minorities and ""left behind"" communities to internationally make aware of their suffocation and look for support globally - which I think is a very powerful tool!Lastly, I eye-witnessed too much ""poverty vacation"" to ever forget about it. Thousands of ""volunteers"" pay a fortune to travel to some random African village and build a well for some random NGO. While there are fantastic NGOs all over the world, and I met many of those, there are also hundreds of NGOs that are nothing more than ""adventure holiday sellers"". That truly disgusts me. All those agencies who offer me ""going to X to build a well in 3 months for only 15.000 Euro"" are either a complete waste of resources or, even though with good intentions, run in the complete wrong direction.I personally strongly believe in the potential of people everywhere on earth's face and I think the best way to raise such potential is not by sending amateurs to build a well, but by approaching them on an eye-level. I personally went to a couple of places where poverty is ever-present and always started by asking ""how can I help you guys?"" and the answer was never: ""Build me a wall"", but ""we need material"", ""we need publicity of our cause"" or ""teach me how to X"". I never even assumed for a second, that I am generally better in ""getting things done"" than any other people I met, because it is just false. I am worse in building wells than everyone whoever touched a brick. What I did is actually working in very poor areas. I got a salary by local standards, sometimes not even 10% of my earnings in Germany, and I did what I am good in: Teaching University level Math, Writing Business Plans, Public Relations, etc.That way I could set a footprint and I am very proud that students I taught made it to international top universities or set up their own successful NGOs or businesses. Those people do now help themselves and their community every single day with the skills they won. Those people are fighting and winning against poverty, because they are skilled and smart and I did my little part to raise that potential.That said, I strongly propose to not treat people different. We should not ""empower minorities"" or ""help people"" who never asked for it. Instead, we should work together with everyone, everywhere and not always look at our benefit - that's all we need to do.Thank you for taking the time to read that and giving me the opportunity to bring in my opinion. Any feedback would be extremely welcome anytime!Should you be interested in the very unique NGO I found, please see www.conifa.org, the first and only NGO that connects people that are ""left behind"", through football, but going much further than that!",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"DisabilityTalking about poverty without analyzing how it affects different groups it is impossible. No all poor individuals or families are the same, and certain groups are more vulnerable to poverty. In the last decades empirical evidence showing the relationship between disability and poverty has increased, but still we do not completely understand how this relationship is created or why. In order to include people with disabilities in social policies and strategies to reduce poverty, we need to know more details about their levels of poverty and deprivation. We need to understand what their needs are and see disability from a human rights perspective, where access to social services and opportunities is the rule and not the exception. Leaving no one behind does not mean including everyone in all types of strategies, without acknowledging their own differences, it is creating a set of strategies that contribute to improve their lives, reducing their levels of deprivation and most important that guarantee equal access to opportunities no matter your health condition or disability status.In the case of disability, we need to know how many they are, what are their characteristics, how poor they are and where are they, we need to collect data on disability, analyse this data and propose informed solutions. This does not mean not to do anything before having the information, but means to make a major effort to improve data on disability, aiming to provide evidence to policy makers in order that they take informed decisions and propose policies that have a real effect on the lives of millions of people with disabilities around the world.",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"The best possible way of including differently abled individuals is enabling them the opportunity to participate from the environment that they have designed for them. Putting them into a common environment and expecting them to feel equal, inclusive and productive is the height of injustice and inhumanity we can ever do to them.Being inclusive doesn't mean or demand the presence, it is just mean the opportunity for participation and contribution must be free of all restriction that would enable individuals to share their skills and knowledge being at their environment of comfort that would further enable them to contribute to their fullest.At present, the policies and the opportunities are not bridged properly and when they are not bridged, inequality and inequities are eventual. On one hand, we campaign for equality and inclusion and on another hand the facilitations we enable are with filters of eligibility, criteria, standards, formats, procedures, frameworks and other such if's, that mandates the process of ""selection-rejection"" where exclusion is its basic trait.When facilitation is through a framework, it facilitates only those who could mould themselves to fit within it and the rest are forced to lead a deprived life with no fault at their end. Individual specific facilitation will support both the government and the world to be inclusive. To government, individual specific facilitation will enable opportunity to facilitate every single citizen for their individuality that is descended to them by nature to serve their purpose of birth. When the purpose of birth is served, individuals of the world will be enabled with progressive attitudes and soul-satisfaction. When there is soul satisfaction, individuals will be void of evacuations and aggression that would seed and spread peace all over the world.To the world, individual specific facilitation will enable the space of being inclusive. When a place is assured for the individuality of all, individually, without any general framework that would put them into the process of ""selection-rejection"", the soul of the individual will be to transcendence and accept the growth and development of all individual which would eventually enable the world to mutualise and multiply the result of contributions made. The general pattern of facilitation, puts an individual into comparison and demands an environment which imposes ""Survival of the fittest"" where expecting individuals to be inclusive, progressive and transcendent is impossible. When individual specific facilitation validated by the UDHR is enabled, there will be no comparison or survival of the fittest environment. Here everyone is considered fittest for their own ability and skills and are enabled opportunity for their inheritance that they already own. In this situation, being inclusive is progressively and holistically possible. Even for the differently abled, the opportunities that are enabled to them as a concession, creates a factor of exclusion to them in the general paradigm where the difference for exclusion is easily created for the partial liberalisation of framework or opportunities.Living for the differently abled is made all the more difficult for this difference of partiality that they receive at ease in the common paradigm. Building confidence and independence to the differently abled are taught or trained in such a way that they are forced to take up rigidity, strong attitude and a quality of adamance and egotism. Which in inside, makes them feels the pressure of being differently abled in greater magnitude.If individual specific pattern is enabled, individuals, be it differently abled or uniquely abled (common individuals having different spectrum of skills) everyone gets their due space for facilitation and participation for what they feel as their core ability or skill, ultimately, evolving an environment that is needed for the world to be inclusive.",1,2,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"I feel that what is hard to achieve is the accessibility of resources by the people who are affected by extreme provety, funds are set aside to assist the less priviliged but unfortunately end up in the hands of greedy people who enrich themselves with this funds, ways and mechanisms should be established to make sure that the funds reach the targeted groups otherwise year after funds will be set aside and the fight against poverty is far from won,",1,0,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"Funding people is not a progressive solution, because,(i) It taxes and exacts equivalence from the productive populace to balance the freebies and financial aid enabled to the populace in poverty.(ii) It doesn't include people in development, when living and livelihood of people in poverty are aided they are excluded from participating in the developmental pursuits of the world. They refrain from fulfilling their duty as a citizen of the world and a constituent of the humanity.

Unless their idleness in life is not taken away, they will eternally constitute to poverty as, once we settle them with all aid and needs, the world, on the other hand, will be progressing continuously making the aid we enabled to them insufficient to balance the growth we accomplish.To elevate people from poverty, we need to include them in the developmental pursuit of the world with opportunities for their individuality. This is a just and progressive way of making the world holistic and equal.Government must be open for people to claim with the opportunity they need for development, duty of the government is not to substantiate people's ability to take up opportunity it has stipulated or officiated as common or general but to include all of its citizens individually facilitating them with all progressive opportunities they design for their individuality ensuring that every citizen's life and functioning of the world is set productive.",1,1,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1I totally agree with you. Most state institutions especially in Africa have been infested by a virus called corruption. The needy are not the eventual beneficiary of funds.,1,0,0,1,3,0,1,0,0,1"It seems like we are not talking about same certain kind of people Dr.Priya ,you see in Kenya where I come from there are people who live in extreme poverty that they cant even be in a position to be in the know how of what is happening in the world ,somehow you are contradicting yourself in your comment when you say that funding the poor is not the solution and yet you go again and say that there is need to find how they can get aid and their needs be addressed ,my point is and I have seen this as a greater problem to poverty eradication ,few educated selfish people are aware of the resources provided to fight poverty and unfortunately take advantage of this grants to enrich themselves ,the opportunities and funds never address the actual beneficiaries that is why my suggest is that grassroot organizations and local administration should be involved in the process of eradicating poverty ,otherwise research has shown that there are some group of people disguise themselves as NGOS to receives funding not for humanity but for themselves",1,1,3,1,1,0,1,0,0,1"Ms.Alice Kamau, it is not contradicting, there is a difference, funding people directly is not a solution because it idles them without taking part in the progress of the nation and the world. Be it poor or rich, educated or uneducated, employed, unemployed or underemployed everyone, every single individual being, constitute to the nation's and globe's identity and development, when they are simply granted with funding and subsidies, we are taking away their share of developmental quotient that prevents us from accomplishing holistic and full development. Helping them to aid their needs and living, means, the government help people with opportunities to education and employment for their individual skill and preference without generalising the means and content of knowledge that enables every single individual of the nation and the globe to nurture their individual skills and ability to a useful form making them earn their living and life standards by contributing their share of progress to the world. There is a difference here and they do not contradict. Yes, funding and resource provided to people doesn't reach them and are confiscated by middlemen. This is the case not only in Kenya but in almost all places.  Even though this is wrong and illegal, we got to look into the mindset behind. NGOs, middlemen and the stream through which the funds and resources reach the poor are no better than the poor. Their living, life pattern and life standards would be a line higher than the poor, when the poor could be granted with all benefits just for being poor without doing any work, wouldn  »t they find it justified to take a part of it as they are no better than the poor and that they aren  »t like the ones getting benefitted with the funds and resources for free, they work. Being poor doesn  »t stop with what we define through the calculations we make through a specific formula, anyone who is unable to meet with his/her needs of his self or his family is poor.  When the act of freely enabling grant to people cannot be justified, the justification middlemen have for taking a part of aid cannot be renounced or refuted. Benefits, social value, perks and allowance to government officials are enabled to make them transcend in including all progressive opportunities people claim for their progress and prosperity.People in the middle take advantage of the resources enabled to poor only when it is materialistic benefits, but when we concentrate on alleviating poverty through facilitating liberated opportunities for education and work that makes individual to lift themselves from poverty there can be no confiscation or inequity.In a democratic and free world or nation, it isn  »t just to say people are unaware and ignorant, because, democracy is government for, of and by the people. It is the duty of the government to lift people from their ignorance. NGO  »s or any other volunteering organisation should connect the citizen with the government and must not work in a way that annuls or overrules the government and its working. Volunteering activities and NGO  »s should orient government in fulfilling its duty and must provide cognisance to the citizens in being responsible and to take part in the progress of the nation and in the functioning of the government. Instead when volunteering organisation break the link between the citizens and government, dominating with their presence it is a sign for another deprivation and uprise  of conflict. Nothing more can be immoral or vile or appalling for a world than for its citizens to retort or revolt against its government due to fear, suspicion or distrust. NGOs and volunteering organisation shouldn  »t be to prove the government to be incapable or in inability, instead it should add to the government and strengthen it.When the informed citizens could be liberated from the general frameworks of the government that enable them to participate in the works of the nation for their individuality, we can include the excluded populace within the general framework and enable them with the needed support and guidance to nurture themselves in becoming sovereign individuals.

I am from Zimbabwe and my view is that past policies have failed to address poverty issues because they have not been putting the needs for the citizens at the forefront. For example, national budgets allocations have neglected more allocation to socio-economic rights, meaning budgets have not been pro-poor. They have not prioritised allocations to ministries dealing with education, health, water and sanitation but rather to security ministries such as defence and home affairs at a time when a country is not at war at all. Governments budgets have failed to meet the international benchmarks e.g. the Abuja Declaration implored countries to allocate at least 15% of their budget towards health, Maputo Declaration  requires 10% of the budget towards agriculture and the Dakar Declaration requires 20% budget allocation towards education. These social economic rights are drivers towards lifting people out of poverty.Secondly, various studies show that the nexus between economic growth and poverty reduction is decent employment. It is not the quantum of employment that will lift our people out of poverty but is the the quality of employment that lifts people out of poverty. May of the African people are trapped in jobs in the informal econ0omy with low productivity and indecent working conditions. Policies should aim at supporting people in the informal economy to high productivity levels. Unfortunately mot government policies only focus on the formal economy (which is already shrinking) and neglecting focusing on the informal economy where the majority of the people are.Thirdly, there is need for African governments to serious about using the vast natural resources to transform the lives of people. Plugging the holes of Illicit financial flows from natural resources and redirecting it towards socio-economic development is also a master key to catapult people out of poverty.

This is a good way to keep track of the effectiveness of policies in leaving no one behing in the achievement of the SDGs worldwide. Agriculture is the primary driver to abate hunger and reduce poverty, which is felt acutely in rural areas. Throughout history, agricultural prosperity has gone hand in hand with successful economies. And food security has a direct impact on national security  ñpolitically, socially and economically. Food security and nutrition also underpin achievement of health goals. Goal 2 inextricably links nutrition to agriculture, as well as to many other Goals related to health, land use, climate change, water, sanitation, education, employment, social protection, infrastructure, gender equality and resilience. For this reason, it is crucial that all stakeholders contribute actively to leave no one behind and moreover, that no one is left hungry. Moreover, eradicating poverty and hunger are integrally linked to boosting food production, agricultural productivity and rural incomes. In order to ensure the boost of investments in food production and agriculture in general, public and private capital flows and development assistance are going to be needed more and more to provide farmers and agri-entrepreneurs with healthy soils, water and plant genetic resources that are key inputs into food production.Finally, a full commitment to global partnership and cooperation will help in the full realization of the SDGs. At this respect, all efforts should be framed around the 5 key Ps: people, planet, prosperity peace and partnerships. These should also entail synergistic solutions, recognising the interconnectedness of distinct environments and populations and based on clear indicators able to be operationalized in differing contexts.

My country is Bangladesh.There are so many problems in developing countries. We have to face it in present & in future. Problems we face are our reality and wait for help in finding solutions to reduce future risks.In my point of view I try to highlight the problems.Population in our country increasing day by day but land not increasing parallel.  They cut the green area specifically the agricultural land by building houses & making unplanned extremely big residential housing projects in different prominent places specifically the capital city as well as district town in the country. This unplanned use of agricultural land will lead to a shortage of agricultural crops in this region. As a result, increasing poverty & population rapidly with decreased agricultural food production.People have to migrate for searching works in different cities & countries. In many family working people are living abroad for their work and sending foreign remittances for their families in village. Their family has to depend on purchasing everything for their daily family needs. Due to shortage of agriculture land they are not directly involved with agricultural production. Farmers are facing hard crisis for agricultural land for food production and on the other part aristocrat class & landlords has huge lands found in uncultivated, barren or partly cultivated. To eradicate poverty we need kind attention on it. We have to more caring for our poor farmers so that they can be able to find cultivable agricultural land or farmers can get adequate leased  cultivable agricultural land from aristocrat class & landlords for increasing our agricultural production.     The world population is increasing so very rapidly and cultivable agricultural land is not enough so to eradicate poverty specifically developing countries need special care on highly technologically advanced & sophisticated agricultural production systems.7. 4 billion The world population in 2016.(reference: http://www.prb.org/pdf16/prb-wpds2016-web-2016.pdf )526 Average global population per square kilometer of arable land   î 239 in more developed countries, 697 in less developed.

Agriculture is the largest source of income and employment for poor rural families.2.6 billion people depend directly on agriculture, but 52 per cent of the land used for agriculture is moderately or severely affected by soil degradation 74 per cent of the poor are directly affected by land degradation globallyMicrocredit is sometimes is not suitable for all class of borrowers or farmers because all class of borrowers are not able to change their economic position because they don  »t know or they don  »t have proper skills how to use credit to generate income. Sometimes farmers are failing to pay the loan on time and they search for another loan to repay the high interest loan. Two factors limit the use of credit as an instrument for poverty eradication, credit cannot be easily targeted to reach the poor & the poorest of the poor cannot make use of credit because they are in no position to undertake an economic activity.  ìThe non-entrepreneurial poor do not know how to use credit to generate income.  ù...  ùThe fact is that the vast majority of the most destitute and the ""poorest of the poor"" are likely to figure among the non-entrepreneurial poor although there is no conclusive evidence of a direct relationship between the level of poverty and the skills and willingness to run a business.  ù...  ù Yet while all poor people need to own more assets to generate more income, not all of the poor can express a viable demand for credit to finance the acquisition of these assets. In fact, as mentioned above, the poorest are the least likely to be in a position to express such a demand.  ù (p. 8)Source: Garson, Jose. Microfinance and Anti-Poverty Strategies.

Every activity that both pursued by the citizens and by the government are aimed towards money making or economic gains where we left behind the chains and intermediate factors that connects workmanship and economy. The actual process of development is workmanship -> progress -> economy. In today's rapid world people or the world doesn't work for progress but directly for economy, this takes away the purpose, balance and equity in development.Agriculture today is not given any focus because we did not focus in upgrading the workings of agricultural sector. Before the wave of science and technology captured and held the world within its influence, people lived with nature. They know to read and live according to the signs shown to them by the nature. Today, the world is not so. We don't know nature, without looking into the atmospheric conditions, we sow our fields, half the way through the yielding process, there would be rain unconditioning the soil, killing the crop. Immediately we would demand subsidy or recompense for the loss from the government. The next year we will not learn from our mistake but continue with our routine for the excuse government gives through subsidy and recompense. After two - three repetition government would allocate a portion in the budget permanently as subsidy for farmers, eventually leaving behind the purpose of agriculture and the produces it would make. We don't find alternatives for resources. Water for our agricultural activities merely depends upon river and other direct form of use readily available. We don't condition soil during rain that could collect rain water to fill or refill the ground water table that would help us with our agricultural activities in summer. Citing lack of water we demand drought relief fund from government. So on the whole neither the government, nor the farmers association nor co-operative society nor the agricultural graduates concentrates on bringing back the environmental condition needed for healthy agricultural produce but sit back and relax for the sustenance enabled to the farmers as subsidy or recompense.

Governments must recognise the value of data available from grassroots organisations, as this can bolster or complement official data. Based on experience from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) we cannot afford to fall behind with measuring our progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Governments and civil society, must work collectively as early as possible and with greater urgency, with the indicator framework and associated monitoring systems related with the SDGs, to ensure the achievement of the 2030 Agenda.  Collection at the local level is more nimble than at the national level. Given the pace of change in today's world, issues and problems can change during a five year period, so the national data collected five years ago that is published now may not be totally relevant. An interactive dialogue and multi-stakeholder workshops amongst civil society and governments to jointly develop data collection can contribute to identifying those who are left behind.In the experience of Soroptimist International (SI), the collection of data at local level related to community needs is vital to ensure those needs are fulfilled, and thus the SDG targets are met. SI works with Prison Reform Trust (PRT) in the UK to inform policy and practice, and prosecution and sentencing guidelines with data analysis; using well researched good practice and thematic briefings for those working with women in penal system. SI conducted both qualitative and quantitative research at a grassroots level which impacted UK government decisions. This project underpins the achievement of several SDGs, including Goal 4, lack of education and training opportunities causing unemployment and poverty are often drivers for offending, and Goal 5, gender-specific offences can lack consideration of the circumstances (including children) and treatment in detention. Systems fail to recognise the role sexual abuse and domestic violence play in women  »s offending. SI and PRT project highlights how an NGO can produce data which can directly monitor, demand or drive change for a vulnerable group.  More information can be found in the report, Transforming Lives. Soroptimist International also assists women who provide the primary source of financial support for their families by giving them the resources they need to improve their education, skills and employment prospects. Each year, more than $1.6 million in education grants are awarded to more than 1,200 women, many of whom have overcome enormous obstacles including poverty, domestic violence and/or drug and alcohol abuse. Live Your Dream Awards recipients must be enrolled in, or have been accepted to, a vocational/skills training programme or an undergraduate degree programme, and demonstrate a financial need. The women may use the cash award to offset any costs associated with their efforts to attain higher education, such as books, childcare, tuition and transportation. This grant has increased the standard of living for 82% of these women, and consistent data monitoring ensures that this programme reaches the some of the most vulnerable women in society.Ensuring robust systems are in place and utilised to collect reliable data and statistics disaggregated by sex and age, will enable us to identify the poorest groups so that targeted policy interventions can reach them, leaving no one behind. Consistent monitoring over time will provide evidence if these groups have made any progress or are still being left behind. One area of importance, is the inclusion of women  »s marital status in data, as this can be a primary determinant to the right to inherit property. Until all governments include imperative indicators such as this in their data collection, civil society will continue its role in pressing governments by highlighting the data which they themselves have collected. We must ensure citizen-generated data can contribute to the achievement of the SDGs, including the implementation and    follow-up and review  » of the goals.Thank you.",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"To eradicate power and leave no one behind requires a conscious effort to dealing with the causes of poverty. Measures should go beyond tokenism to encompass direct support to productivity in agriculture, manufacturing, quality education and health services, and affordable and innovative financial services. Most countries in Africa require boost in agriculture productivity and its value chain. There is therefore the need to provide direct support to agriculture in making available to the farmers simple but effective technologies, improved seedlings, and securing of land banks for medium to large scale farmers and granting some tax concessions to these farmers. In addition, governments need to provide agriculture extension services to some groups who would not be able to afford these services. The support should be comprehensive and well-thought through on case-by-case basis, depending the needs and challenges in affected areas and systems. Regarding manufacturing support, governments need to ensure that doing business in their various countries are inexpensive, cordial and friendly. It is important to ensure that there is cheap and reliable sources of energy, simple administrative procedures (especially regarding taxes and company registrations). Other complementary conducive environmental factors also need to be in existence, such as good road network, efficient transport system and operative labor policies and laws that provide benefits for investors and labor equally. Social services like education and health need to be improved upon to ensure educated and healthy society for increased productivity and creativity. It would not be enough to provide educational and health facilities and human resources to run the facilities, but there is the need to ensure that these facilities are well equipped and manned. It is of no use to have a hospital or classroom with the required testing machines or better learning materials respectively. In order to create that environment, which would ensure that transactions are carried out with ease, we need to embrace digital financial services and do well to reduce its accompanied transaction fees to ensure inclusive financial systems. This system would ensure efficiency as well as would carry everybody along, thanks to mobile money and other transaction platforms coming up.Another issue to be considered is sustainable use of natural resources, and production. Production and extraction of natural environment should lead to the human development of the people.  In effect, eradicating poverty should be addressed through a more integrated approach than through a single window approach. All the interventions should be explored to leverage on synergies that may exist between sub-sectors of the economy. By attaining the Goal 1 of the SDGs, efforts must be made to ensure that all other goals attained. Therefore policy coherence (both horizontal and vertical) is vital in undertaking this agenda. It is therefore to say that all other goals are critical for the attainment of each of the goals of the SDGs.",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"I believe the sustainable path to eradicating poverty is from the inside-out...via personal empowerment, effective leadership and collaborative partnership-building with all stakeholders. This includes the so-called 'poor' people being at the decision-making table. Why? Because expanding consciousness is at the heart of all transformation. The UN's focus is typically on data collection/research, knowledge-sharing, technical capacity-building, institution-building and policy development. While these are pieces to the puzzle, it is not the whole picture.  This is a limited strategy that discounts the mysterious yet powerful, multi-dimensional realm of people development.  Data without leadership is insufficient.  Policy without inner enrollment is just another control strategy that attempts to force compliance. An holistic people-centered approach ought to balance the left-brain with the right-brain - the rational logical side with the inclusive, creative side - masculine action with feminine reflection - reconciling the greed of over-consumption with the scarcity of poverty consciousness that lives within all of us. Earth stewardship is the needed frame for the picture of poverty.  For how we connect and relate to self and others is a mirror to how we do so with the environment.   How can we learn from the natural ebb and flow of nature, taking only what we need rather than what we want?  This involves an inner exploration of our attitudes about money and being worthy of support.  We need to dispel the myth that there is not enough, that more is better and that's just the way it is.  The empowerment journey out of poverty involves embodying the principle of sufficiency - being in right relationship with the inner/outer resources of life.  Voluntary belief and behavior change is often perceived to be too challenging, too ambiguous, too touchy feely and too hard to measure.  But this is where the gold is found -- for the wisdom and the solutions are ultimately within.  Global change needs to be bridged to the local level.  The macro of shifting systems is rooted in the micro of personal growth.As the Hopi elders taught us, ""We are the ones we have been waiting for.""As a bridge-builder, I offer the Bridging Leaders Program, a six-month learning platform that advances SDG results on the ground.  Attached is an overview for consideration, with the above noted threads weaved into the fabric of the program.",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"Poverty has been closely connected with education, health and environmental sustainability.  we always for get that human need have been prioritized so greatly work towards the 2030 Agenda, governments need to provide comprehensive approaches across sectos, bringing together relevant ministries to addressing cross-cutting issues in a more coordinated manner. Making Agriculture the lead coordinating ministry. Agriculture remains the largest sources of income and employment for rural families. Not just if we look closely we will see the the basic needs of Man is in Agriculture not education, even Good Health will naturally be when Agriculture takes it place. I seriously recommend support to small farmers and other informal sectors (women most importantly) should be not just part but the lead solution in many countries Private sector should be incentivized to become part of the solution. Co-operatives also offer a more value-based/people-centred model that can be important contributors to eradicating poverty. National governments could support the development of cooperatives as a tool for local communities to address their own needs and to help ensure that the wealth generated by economic activity remains in the communities.If this can be well taken care of believe me people now know that there os need to have good education and good health. So they will naturally get that when the have food on their table, have roof over their head and clothing to wear and have the needed cash to pursue education.

There are limitations in current methods as the method beneficiaries are not truly engaged in the method developments, so it would be highly challenging to expect significant output or outcomes measuring poverty reduction approaches. The sentence ""leaving on one behind"" is a great slogan but to materialize it, need something to be explored to reach to the users levels. There is a need to be developed scorecards to measure the current system - what worked and what did not and develop better options based on the findings.

The role of governments in providing access to basic services, a conducive environment and corruption free governance as well as the role of coordinated and collaborative engagement of stakeholders in poverty eradication is vital. But this is known and recognised and yet very little progress seems to be taking place on the ground. We need to go further to elaborate on the people- centred approach.So what is the missing link here? Are the poorest of the poor, the marginalised and the vulnerable, the possible and passive beneficiaries of government and NGO/CSO largesse, never going to have a say in their development. For far too long the development community has decided what is good for them; their voices are still not heard. So it is time that we direct efforts towards reaching out to them, ensuring they count and make them partners in their development rather than craft top down approaches.The other major players are the people's representatives, the parliamentarians and the politicians, who are also often missing from the actual work to be done for the marginalised. Their commitment and accountability in poverty eradication is the channel for transmitting the needs of the poor to duty bearers as well as translating the benefits available to these poor communities. In Africa and some of the LDCs (at least those I have worked in) traditional leaders and chiefs as well as faith based organisations are very powerful. They are also custodians of a large amount of data and information on those left behind and their buy-in and commitment is critical to inclusive development and poverty eradication.

Until women and men are able to have the number of children they want and can support, their poverty is likely to become worse. Their health, and that of their children, is also badly affected by involuntary pregnancies, unsafe childbirth, and illegal abortions.   There can be no escape from poverty without better health. There can be no health improvement without good contraception. This should be integrated into ALL development programmes. At the moment funding is being threatened, especially by current US Government policy. If it is integrated into all programmes (as the World Bank is beginning to do) it will be much safer. Come on UNDP, lead the way on this.",1,2,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"Thank you for this platform that will enable the global community to air the views and suggestion in regard to the implementation of SDG 1 and related SDGsI would like to address the first question on how policies need to be adjusted in different contexts to ensure they are more effective. First, I highly advocate for the theme of inclusiveness. In order to promote the implementation of SDGs and address all the priorities it is apparently of high importance to recognize the groups that are directly affected by a particular issue. For instance, to promote gender equality or youth empowerment through decent jobs etc, it is important to involve the targeted groups or their representatives to air their views and opinions as well as to share the kind of challenges they are facing so that when lobbying actors towards the implementation of these goals, at least a lasting solution can be found to address the challenges of the affected groups.Civic education is another important factor to consider, as it will raise awareness of people's rights as well as their responsibilities at an individual level in supporting and promoting the implementation of SDGs.Creating an enabling environment for Civil Society Organization and Local Authorities will give them  an opportunity to fulfill their roles as active, effective and necessary agents of development. CSOs and LAs perceive the SDGs as a valuable framework which they can use for their own work. CSOs are eager to take up their role of a watchdog to hold governments accountable for their commitments while the LAs ensure the integration of development and sustainability issues in the goals as well as linking them jointly to policies and practices at the local level. Hence, LAs and CSOs are in better position in ensuring that the necessary policies are adhered to in implementation of SDGs.It is imperative to recognize the key actors and drivers of the development goals at all levels. As a representative of Co-operatives, it is of high importance to recognize the efforts that co-operatives are putting in place in advocating for the implementation of SDGs. Examples of some of the work co-operatives are doing to advance the SDGs can be found on the online platform 'Coops for 2030' (www.coopsfor2030.coop)Co-operatives play a major role in advocating for development agenda as well as ensuring policy coherence. Cooperatives are owned and democratically controlled by members that amount to more than one billion worldwide. They secure the livelihoods of more than 250 million people by providing decent jobs and/or being the main source of income. They are a powerful source in the economy of many countries with combined annual revenues of more than USD 2.5 trillion.  Cooperatives are value based and people centered enterprises that can be major contributors towards eradicating poverty, providing food security and decent employment, ensuring gender equality and women empowerment, protecting the environment as well as fostering the implementation of other SDGs amongst their members and partners. Therefore, it is imperative for co-operatives to be recognized as part of the key drivers of development agenda and promoters of enabling environment for investments through supportive cooperative policies.Thank you.",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"Free pre-K education and childcare, which involves immersive learning programs for mothers as well, can fill an opportunity through emphasis of an intervention in the first few years of life.

This rapid cognitive development can be supported through free nutrition, education for every child.

",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"Zero poverty is a very ambitions but not unattainable target. I know from personal experience that poverty is dynamic and changes form as people, societies and countries emerge from different situations and stages in development. That should make its eradication an interminable pursuit that would require continuously evolving policies, approaches and interventions. Eradicating poverty and leaving no one behind should be made mutually reinforcing: while eradicating poverty focuses on issue-based targeting of individuals and communities belonging to a predefined socio-economic bracket, the 'leave no one behind' concept is ensuring the drive is dynamic, inclusive and participatory.Leave no one behind should be used as the guiding principle to drive policies and programmes that allow for people's choices and preferences in how they want to deal with their form of poverty. He who bears or feels it, knows it. In measuring progress towards zero poverty, we would need a complete upgrade on the use of mainstream monitoring, evaluation (M&E) and results-based management (RBM) approaches. We have to adopt more flexible and adaptable methods that look beyond the desired outputs, outcomes and impacts of our interventions. It means we should start looking over and above the real value of what we do to their opportunity and social costs. Many a time, one great intervention has produced one long lasting burden or dis-benefit. While M&E or RBM would identify those, it would not ensure there are robust actions to address them because its primary focus is the desired results. For instances, establishing a poverty eradication commission in a country where the need is obvious and ensuring that the commission is fully functional would be an excellent result. However, it comes at a cost or addition burden to national and local government who would have to assure the long-term survival of that institution. For such a reason, some would naturally die or become dysfunctional. May be our focus should have been to assist government address leakages in revenue collection in order to have a functional Poverty Eradication Commission.I would say 'Leave no one behind' is quite a golden catch phrase that is much more than it seems. To work toward zero poverty would require policies, programmes and interventions that adopt more flexible, inclusive and participatory approaches  at all stages in the programme or policy cycle as well as performance and measurement systems beyond the desired results.",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"I'd very much like to make you aware that there is not poverty only in Africa. In countries that have a higher level of living and a higher GDP per inhabitant, such as countries in our Latin America, eradication of poverty is also a plague. And because we are talking of countries with an average GDP per inhabitant higher than a number of countries in Africa, one must agree with a series of comments that have been made by many of you recently in this rich debate. To wit, that economic development is not enough to take a great number of people away from poverty. I have mentioned at the early stages of our discussion, that there still is around 30 percent of poverty in Argentina. Between 2003 and up to around 2008/2009, Argentina grew at a rate it had not seen in all of her history since her political organization that began around 1853 (after her war of independence from Spain in 1810 and internal struggles between 1820 and 1852). Economics cannot explain how after the best growth period in our history, essential based on the international price of soy bean, we still have about 30 percent of poverty. So, yes, as many of you have said, other considerations must be considered in analysing how best to channel aid. Corruption is indeed a key consideration. If for political reasons the institutions that are responsible for aid at the top of the aid pyramid refrain from belling this huge Cat, are afraid from looking this huge Cat in the eyes, our efforts, the aid, will be inefficiently, most inefficiently used. But, as many of you have pointed out, Corruption is not the only variable in this delicate equation. There is a question of aid for education, food and shelter to be channelled to people that are able to look into some kind of future (I've said this before, yes). So there is this need to ""prepare"" people to step away from poverty. People who know, say that if you are so poor you are bound to believe that is a station in life from which you have no means of getting away from. Have you never felt that way when in dire straits? So here psychologists and psychiatrists need come into play. As I mentioned when I said this before, this is based on studies on poverty by Doctor Facundo Manes in Argentina, who is now part of a multidisciplinary team working in the poorer pockets within the Argentine province of Buenos Aires. And agriculture being a key mean of income in Africa as it is in Argentina , here Sustainable Development considerations come into play, which I mentioned before -though not in depth- and with which I will not burden you now. ",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"As it was in the context of MDGs , in pursuing the SDGs poverty eradication does not mean and will not mean ""leaving no one behind"". The dynamics of socio-politico-economic development including ''economic growth"" are such that in all countries including the most developed there is the phenomenon of inequality. Therefore, to manage expectations there is need to unbundle the term ""leaving no one behind"" to move its meaning from slogan to operational guide. Given the current inequality between rich and poor  countries, between rich and poor individuals, what does ""leaving no one behind"" really mean to a, for example a public servant, or a policy maker?   ìleaving no one behind  ù has strong ideological undertones including egalitarianism, equality, equity, involvement, inclusiveness, engagement, collaboration, social security,  and socio-economic welfare. When you commit to effectively implement the 2030 Agenda and achieve its 17 SDGs with their 169 targets leaving no one behind, (the disadvantaged, people living with disabilities, the children, the women, the youth, people living in abject poverty, people displaced by wars and conflict, people in remote areas, generations of the future etc), an ideology that emphasizes inclusiveness, participation, engagement, equality, equity, and most importantly, the delivery of services to all as well as social security and welfare  is assumed and required. The provision of services to achieve the SDGs inevitably brings to the foreground the role of the welfare state. The framers of the 2030 Agenda did not mention the ideological underpinnings that would ensure that Sustainable Development gets achieved leaving no one behind. The following can be interpreted as possible components of the meaning of leaving no one behind: In the development process identifying and providing support and assistance to those furthest behind firstIdentifying and targeting the most vulnerableTaking a multidimensional including bottom-up approach and giving voice and listening to the vulnerable and furthest behindAvoiding measuring progress in averages which mask the real poorest vulnerable people left behindEnsuring everyone especially the most vulnerable has opportunity and shares actions, outcomes (especially the consumption of goods and services) and in the progress madeInvolving and engaging everyone especially the poorest and most vulnerable in searching for and creating solutions to the development problems and challenges they faceStarting with the kind of data that can enable public administration to know who the most vulnerable are, where they live and what their needs are (the needs as determined through the situation analysis involving the vulnerable).Putting in place legal frameworks, policies, strategies and programs which are directly targeting the vulnerable populationsPutting in place measures (safety nets) which ensure that those who make positive steps to get out of poverty do not slip back  The whole phenomenon of ""leaving no one behind"" in poverty eradication must address (in addition to getting the poor out of poverty according to the SDG goals and targets), the phenomenon of inequality. Note that countries which have made headway in poverty eradications according to the MDGs performance are facing problems of social instability that are caused by, among other things, inequality.",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"Hello everyone!So the eradication of poverty is not as simple as it seems because it involves the culture of each country. However, we have to think that the eradication of poverty is only possible through political, educational, social and economic changes. I think changes have to start at two key points:> Eradication of corruption in the political so as to ensure that public money is used fairly and consciously for the people. Create laws that guarantee punishment for political corruption. Guarantee the distribution of income in a more egalitarian way to the society of each country. There is also a need to invest in the eradication of slave labor, often in poor or developing countries. In the century that we are it is impermissible to use something from the source of slave labor or the result of corruption. We have to change the way we think. We have to think of collective solutions, global and not individual.> Ensure access to quality free education for all children, young people and adults. Changes in the basis of school education must begin. It is impossible for a child to learn anything at school if that child is feeling hungry or thinking about problems of his family, such as domestic violence, drug addiction, unemployment and so on. I think that it is possible to guarantee a good future for a poor child if they have access to quality education, health and food. We have to guarantee a home for children who do not have a home and that sleep on the streets. And for children who have a home, but a family who struggle against poverty, it must be ensured that even if these children remain with their families, these children are guaranteed that they will be able to choose fair paths in the future, or to reinforce school education with values   †  †and principles that encourage children to escape poverty through education. For this, too, it is necessary to ensure that children in school education reach the university and do not give up. If we invest in education we will have a chance to change the way we think about the future. Our current children will be emotionally strong and conscious adults and with more right choices  in the future.And here it is also necessary to reflect on how to educate our poor children so that they leave the poverty knowing to make use of the sustainable development. I repeat, we need to invest more in education at all levels. Education is the basis for any change.Investing in poverty eradication education may seem slow in the long term, but it is guaranteed and Fair and secure investment in quality and this should ensure free access to well prepared food, school materials, health and teachers.Children are the future of a country, of Planet. However, how to eradicate poverty without leaving anyone behind?For children, young people, adults and the elderly, regardless of social class, culture, ethnicity, color, religion, etc (girls, boys, women and men):- Eradicate corruption in politics;- To eradicate slave job or underpaid job in all every place;- Invest more in quality education and free to those who can not pay;- Ensure access to quality and free health for those who can not afford it;- Ensuring a home for people living on the streets;- Invest more in food security. We have to ensure the food get to everyone's table. Currently, the model of large-scale agriculture does not guarantee food for all, but rather the enrichment of a few and the degradation of natural resources such as soil, water, forests and wildlife.",1,2,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"There is, dear colleagues, apart from UN Agencies, governmental agencies and ONGs, another way to channel either work, co-work or funds/food/building material to aid poor communities, and that is Corporate Employee Volunteerism (CEV). In 2015 our Center for Sustainable Development Education at Universidad Austral in Argentina had the academic coordination of the ""2015 Report on Corporate Employee Volunteerism in Ibero America"". It starts with words from former UN General Secretary Mr. Ban Ki-Moon: ""Volunteerism is a source of community strength, resilience, solidarity and social cohesion. It brings positive social change by fostering respect for diversity, equality and the  participation of all. It is among society's most vital assets."" It does not only involve helping and working together with the poor, but also with those handicapped, with the old. This kind of aid is a source, as Ban Ki-Moon says, of strength, resilience, solidarity and social cohesion. In Argentina many groups of employees, often together with their bosses, take a long week end to go far from the big cities to communities at the foot of the Andes or in our north-eastern forests  taking food, clothes, medicine and building materials with them and work for three or four full days with the members of the com munity to build a small school, a sanitary post, revamp a small house. They also teach and teach crafts. And they eat there together with the people, and sleep there. Get involved. It is not putting money in an envelope and forgetting about it. It is about CARING. Many corporations join hands with specialised NGOs to carry out these missions. However, to make this kind of work an efficient tool, it is the corporations that do this systematically, with a horizontal knowledge of volunteerism (which must be taught, kept and maintained as a company policy), that are efficient vehicles in the struggle against poverty. In these cases there is a whole lot of members of the firm at all levels, of different professions, that often begin to share their time with privately owned institutions that work in our struggle against poverty. Their working together with the people they help enhances the quality of their aid and creates social bonds that cannot be created otherwise.Note: the investigation work referred to here was carried out by our team at Universidad Austral's Centre for Sustainable Development Education together with Cooperacií_n Internacional ONG, Iberdrola and Voluntare in 2015. It covered many months of the year 2015.",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"Many interesting ideas have been shared in this discussion, as many, we could say, as people contributing. I would like to reflect in this post about how do we (maybe experts, but with no direct experience of extreme poverty) talk about poverty. How do we define poverty? How do we measure poverty? What solutions we propose?Do we, experts, but with no direct experience of poverty, would talk in the same way if we were men talking about gender issues in an e-discussion where no single women contributed? Would the participation of women in the discussion shape the conversation in a different way? Is there interest in such participation?If we were white people with expertise about racism, would we talk in the same way in a discussion where not a single person of color is present? Would the participation of people with African descent, for example, shape the conversation in a different way? Will this allow white people to see things from a different perspective? In which voice is there a stronger legitimacy? Is it worth to create the conditions for such participation?In a very famous speech in 2005 Mandela compared poverty with slavery and apartheid: ""Like slavery and apartheid, poverty is not natural. It is man-made and it can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings.""People living in extreme poverty often describe their experience of poverty with feelings that could be very similar to the ones felt by slaves and people living under the apartheid.  ìThe worst thing about living in extreme poverty is the contempt, that they treat you like you are worthless, that they look at you with disgust and fear and that they even treat you like an enemy. We and our children experience this every day, and it hurts us, humiliates us and makes us live in fear and shame.  ùThe fight against slavery and apartheid was first and foremost fought from the inside, many slaves and people under apartheid rebelled and fought to change their situation and this fight was recognized and supported by others.With poverty the story is very different, most of the narrative depict people in poverty at the receiving end of the efforts and very rarely they are considered actors, much less the most important stakeholders in this fight. With this narrative we don  »t only ignore the efforts that people in poverty make to live in dignity, to improve their communities, to build peace in the midst of insecurity, uncertainty and scarcity, but we deny their existence. With this narrative we reduce people in poverty to victims.I would like to end this post with a small contribution towards changing this narrative.ATD Fourth World is carrying out a pilot project in partnership with the University of Oxford to develop indicators of multi-dimensional poverty. The project hinges on participatory research that combines the perspectives of key stakeholders and prioritizes the views of people with direct experience of material and social deprivation.The partnership stems from a shared understanding of the inadequacies of existing ways of thinking about and measuring poverty, and the conviction that these can be addressed by conducting rigorous scientific research alongside people who have direct experience of poverty and who will be co-creators of new knowledge.The research seeks to refine the understanding and measurement of poverty by engaging with people with direct experience, practitioners and academics to contribute to more sensitive policy design at national and international level and thereby to greater reductions in poverty.For more information about this project: http://www.atd-fourthworld.org/international-advocacy/measuring-poverty/",1,3,3,1,0,1,1,0,0,1"I think that we cannot eradicate poverty as long as it is ""labeled"" according to economic standards. In other words, as long as a ""poor"" individual is described so in case he/she has less than 1 dollar per day, we would still have segregation between wealthy populations and poor populations.However, as mainly presented in previous comments, I think that if poverty just can be re-labeled in its human/social perspective, there would be a high chance to be gradually eradicated. The description of poor individual could be "" An unlucky man/woman who was born in a place where he/she was deprived the access to basic needs for a decent life that any human has the right to deserve on planet earth once born and had the right for life"". Do you know that the only species that have to pay for their food on this planet are the Human species? Do you know that the only species that have to pay to save their own children from killing diseases are the Human species?  Who accepted that food, medicine, and shelter are no longer public goods? Who accepted that generic drugs can only be made by governments in only specific cases (TRIPS agreement at WTO)? Why only the news bring us images of people dying from hunger, but no corporate would send any excess of their food production to them? Why there is no day in the UN system called Œ‚the global collect day against poverty"" where each UN worker/officer and people all over the globe, volunteer for one day work from their salary to the poor? There is a systematic hinder to eradicate poverty because most of basic needs have become private goods and no longer public goods. Why the UN system do not re-activate the UNCTAD original role as once it was created to track equilibrium between international trade and development needs , by which new infrastructure could decrease the risks for a poor life? The UNCTAD has the mandate to track corporations/Multinationals around the globe and intervene in excess of their pricing and monopolistic strategies.  It could be very utopist to change the whole system, but I think it can be triggered by small and precise actions, especially using IT:  Make Facebook pay a penny for each click, make free access to online scientific research and make patents accessible to developing countries, induce new models of development that are based on minimum loans and local resources (i.e. If someone couldn  »t have access to modern medicine, at least let  »s improve the traditional one) . Creativity and the free flow/exchange of knowledge have helped humanity to survive. If we boost both , I think we would have a good start. In my opinion, the solution to the issue of poverty would be in the next 20 years, it is when the native digital generation will be in decision positions either at UN or else, where their cognitive references would be totally different from those of a generation that was born in a non digital world.   ",1,2,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"""In my opinion, the solution to the issue of poverty would be in the next 20 years, it is when the native digital generation will be in decision positions either at UN or else, where their cognitive references would be totally different from those of a generation that was born in a non-digital world.""     The problem here is not about the generation but about the system itself. The system always demands examples and precedences to accept or recognise a change, any suggestion be it from the generation of digital age or the ones from non-digital generation, it needs to be complex, complicated and hi-fi with lots of mathematical work, data analysis, jargons and most importantly it must be well within the framework and the approach we have officiated. If the suggestion made eases out the working environment or the living of the populace, if the suggestion is different from the routine methodologies and perspectives of the world, that will never be accepted. Why do we expect the social research to be scientific? When calculation enters the social paradigm, it illusions the world lifting it from its original reality. The World by its nature is heterogeneous, we have a diverse array of populace (skills, expertise, interest and living pattern and approach), resources and sources to resources, to bring the entire variance under our computation we take up a factor that is in between the entire array of spread and formulate a general solution on it.

Over all, I agree with the points that have been summarized on eradicating poverty and leaving no one behind. I may add a point that might contribute to the e-discussion here, with a disclaimer: I understand tackling with it would be extremely difficult. It could be called as   ìthe Mother of All the Wars,  ù i.e. land ownership.MPI has an entry of   ìAsset  ù in this regard, but it seems to me the connection between MPI  »s asset and environment, and hence poverty mapping and sustainability, is not so clear. I must emphasize it is definitely not fair for the creators of MPI to bring up the point as the discipline of economics is  not yet strong about the issue. (Database Econ-lit shows mainly the papers of at least 10 year old, and the studied area is concentrated in South Asia and a bit of Africa.) Having said that, as a member of civil society organization for environmental concerns in Megalopolis Tokyo, I have a feeling poverty reduction in sustainable environment is closely linked with land tenure. Disaggregating poverty mapping would be more persuasive when we can incorporate the aspect of land proprietorship one way or another.Japanese system has fairly-well established social registration system, legal arrangement for asset ownership, taxation (and hence related data), and civil society engagement with generous public sector backing in terms of technical and financial aspects. Moreover, after the World War II, democracy was clearly codified in the Constitution, and the previously-divine Emperor became a mere mortal. These days, his now 84 years  » old son cannot quit his job unless the national Diet let him have a happy retirement. That might be an evidence of transparency in governance ;) Regarding education, Japan established nearly 100% elementary school graduation rate (for whomever) long before the World War II. I would say almost all the points the e-discussion raised in the first 2 weeks were realized policy-wise in Japan. 72 years later, our society is not poverty-free, nor paradise of biodiversity. Our community is still struggling to have it   ìjust right.  ù Yet, the take-away from Japanese experience is our accumulated experience for struggle to search for the equilibrium to the cause. The clear definition for the ownership of land is practically the foundation of the process.After the World War II, Japanese government executed the order of General Headquarters of Allied Forces (aka American government) for emancipation of farming lands: they confiscated the land from large landlords and redistributed them to landlords and sharecroppers equally. At that time, the policy solved the rural poverty problem, and indeed   ìno-one left behind  ù including the formerly-rich landlords. Now, the players in Megalopolis Tokyo for sustainable development are title holders of land, recently moved urban residents who recognize the DRR / educational / mental-health functions of greenery in neighborhood, pin-striped developers who love to cash-in land transactions in and around the capital, academic (or otherwise) environmentalists, and local governmental officers whose job is to coordinate the matters. For welfare enhancement of local agricultural community in Megalopolis with such a diverse stake-holders, visible access and understanding of the data concerning the land rights is the starting point of anything.     Somebody could say, hearing anecdotes from Japan,   ìLet  »s ignore the transparency and democracy and make Gini coefficient 1 for a faster result.  ù Not so quick. We, the members of a civil society for urban environment, often jokingly (and cynically) say   ìYou know that the grandpa of Mr. X over there entitled the land 70 years ago, and he and his family established beautiful agri-business and forest as they think their property dear and take care of well. Now, look Mr. Y, a descendant of a former big landlord. His family doesn  »t care their ancestral land. Their place is now rows of detached houses owned by office workers of Tokyo coming from elsewhere. Mr. Y clan is reduced to a small detached house just like us!  ù In the end, a person who thinks his/her property important appropriately takes care of it by toiling on it for a long period, and achieving a decent living for generations. Probably that  »s the goal we try to achieve for poverty reduction in sustainable environment.",1,3,3,2,0,0,1,0,0,1"In an era of falling response rates, it may seem that all household populations are hard to survey, but some populations present special challenges that make them harder. When measuring poverty through poverty surveys, it should be recognized that certain categories of people who may be among the most likely to be poor are frequently omitted from the sampling frame since they do not live in private households. The welfare of marginalized groups such as homeless people (including street children), drug users, sex workers, people who are in institutions (including elderly care homes, children  »s homes, and mental health institutions); people in temporary accommodation or hostels; prisoners; and refugees in camps or illegal immigrants is notoriously difficult to assess systematically.In most demographic studies where representative household surveys are the gold standard for data collection, such marginalized population segments are lost by definition or, at best, are grossly underrepresented. An additional set of problems concerns the willingness of individuals from marginalized, hard-to-reach groups to provide information to survey interviewers, especially about the type of sensitive matters that define their marginality (undocumented migrants), or difficulty in being interviewed (low literacy groups, or where there is a language barrier). It can be argued that the same social characteristics and constraints that hinder access to these individuals may also impair their willingness or ability to answer survey questions. These types of bias led to significant underestimation of poverty rates in EU-SILC.A significant number of children would be excluded from usual survey samples. For example, in many countries in Central and Eastern Europe between 1 and 2 per cent of children are growing up in institutionalized care, and children from poor or excluded backgrounds have been shown to be more likely to be institutionalized. Others are involved in seasonal migration or in marginal or excluded communities (e.g., Roma), whose households may not be included in surveys. Children may be omitted from household responses due to the reluctance of the respondent to recognize as household members foster children, trafficked children, or children who are engaged in hazardous child labour.Some populations are less represented in household surveys because they live in remote areas, enclaves or in families or communities whose presence is illegal and unregistered, for example Roma populations. The challenge remains that surveys are better suited to cover only the easily accessible populations. Covering all the   ìhard to sample  ù,   ìhard to identify  ù,   ìhard to find or contact  ù,   ìhard to persuade  ù or   ìhard to interview  ù categories of respondents may make a survey complicated and costly. Such a challenge must be met with innovative strategies for sampling, identifying, locating, contacting and interviewing.A recent study conducted by Ukraine  »s Academy of Sciences, for example, found a systematic downward bias in the income distribution data of household surveys in Ukraine. Non-response rates for living conditions surveys during 2010-2012 in Kyiv  îUkraine  »s capital region  îwere double the national average, and many times greater than the non-response rates reported for Ukraine  »s poorer rural regions. Correcting this bias would raise Ukraine  »s official Gini coefficient for income equality from 23 to 27 (Sarioglu, 2016).",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"The most important resource on which UN could depend for implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and  the ultimate stakeholders when it comes to the achievement of SDGs, remains untapped. And that is people themselves. We try to rope in governments, INGOs,  CBOs, FBOs, philanthropists, media and what not. But inadequate effort is taken to tap the biggest potential actor of  all which is people themselves.Who , for example, are most  interested in eradicating poverty? In having peace? In ensuring inequality? Politicians? The country governments? More than all of them, people want these goals realised. But people are not organised as viable units to articulate and get things done. They get submerged under various structures and identities like governments, nongovernmental organisations and the like . These structures and identities have their own vested interests and competing goals that can tend to work against the interests of the people.It is time people have their own structures as people, and not merely as subjects of this government under this party or ideology and that non governmental organizaion under this funding agency's priorities or so.When people don't have their own autonomous structures on the basis of nothing else other than their identity as people, they are divided by various factional identities  and unable to express themselves as people of the world.This way my suggestion is that UN tries to work for a structure  where people could speak out as people beyond their national, ideological, religious and other cultural identities.The structure should be such that not some people talk but all people. Even the last and the least person must be a part of such a global articulation process and nobody should be left out.The best way to do this is to start from below, a bottom up approach.UN should muster all its resources and all the supports possible from governments, INGOs, FBOs, CBOs,media and what not, to ensure that people are organised neighbourhood-based Global Goals  or Sustainable Development Goals Communities of about 30 families each.Before I say anything further about this, lest what I am about to say sounds an unrealistic and unrealisable flight of imagination, I need to say that I have been associated with the organisation of hundreds of thousands such neighbourhood communities.For example, the State of Kerala in India, organised 280000 such neighbourhood communities of women in poverty risk for poverty eradication and have federated them already as a three-tier structure at the local governance level. Please visit www.kudumbashree.org to see their achievements. In addition to organising such neighbourhood groups of poor women, the same State has come out with policies which get the  33 million-strong population of the State organised into such small-sized neighbourhood assemblies  (Ayal Sabha) and federated into a three-tier structure for participatory local governance. The State government's Kerala Institute of Local Administration (KILA) has come out with a six volume guidelines on local governance through such neighbourhood assemblies. It  has already initiated orientation and planning sessions on getting these structures work for SDGs. Another experiment of small-sized neighbourhood-based participatory units and their federation at various levels is the neighbourhood parliaments of children. About a hundred thousand units of such units get federated at various levels. They have already a national child prime minister in India. The too are electing 17 child ministers in each unit of their neighbourhood parliament of about thirty children. Accordingly they have elected 17 national child ministers too to represent the SDGs at national level. They also published guideline booklets containing suggestions on what such  ministers for each SDGs could do. Please visit details, www.childrenparliament.in and Facebook page children parliament global. Such neighbourhood-based organisation initiatives are not limited to Kerela either but seen in various other States and countries mostly as non-governmental efforts. Such neighbourhood communities are to be organised all over the world as inclusive geographical territory-based communities so that none is left out. In each of these communities we should have a person each to respond  to an SDG each. Hence 17 ministers in each neighbourhood community of  about  30 families. These neighbourhood communities are to be federated through representative structures at various other levels based on no other consideration than just the number of the units represented at each level. This would mean also a global grassroots-based each for each SDG.5  This should be people's own  autonomous multi-tier global federation for realising UN goals. Pls. Visit www.neighborhoodparliament.org and www.neighbourhoodization.org If UN takes the lead in this regard,people could come together at various levels, and even global level, and dream together and work together for global goals. If the UN takes the lead, many of us are ready to bring our experience and expertise of decades to help.",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"Dear All,Good day!I am providing the following observations in personal capacity and not in official capacity. Agriculture is the mainstay of India with more than half of the Indian population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. The following programmes/schemes which being implemented by different Ministries/Departments ranging from single component/commodity based sectoral scheme to area based integrated approach which are giving dividents with time. These are some example which can be emulated by developing and under developed countries for better agricultural growth.A National Mission on Soil Health Card has been launched to provide soil tested based fertilizer recommendation based on STCR approach to all the farmers in the country based on the twelve soil parameters.The Government under the component of soil health management of  National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) is promoting soil test based balanced and integrated nutrient management in the country through setting up/strengthening of soil testing laboratories, establishment of  bio-fertilizer and compost unit, use of micronutrients, trainings and demonstrations.A number of value added fertiliser materials fortified with secondary and micronutrients have been enlisted in Fertilizer Control Order (FCO) to promote balanced and efficient use of fertilisers.Customised fertilisers specific to crop, soil and area specific are also promoted.The Govt. of India took a historical policy decision of introduction of Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) on N, P, K and Sulphur containing fertilizers. Additional subsidy for fertilizers fortified with zinc and boron was paid at the rate of Rs. 500 and Rs. 300 per tonne, respectively. It well help in ensuring efficient use of plant nutrients including secondary and micronutrients.The Department of Fertilizers, Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers has declared subsidy on city compost @ Rs. 1500 per tonne to serve twin objectives of supporting government  »s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and providing manures to farmers.The government is implementing National Biogas and Manure Management Programme aiming at setting-up of Family Type Biogas Plants at rural and semi-urban/households level for recycling of rural wastes linking sanitary toilets with biogas plants (http://mnre.gov.in/schemes/decentralized-systems/schems-2/).

Thanks and regards.",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"This has been a very rewarding discussion. I feel each one of us has learned a great deal. And once again, Jimmy van de Putt points at the question that has  been the less taken into consideration hitherto, regarding all the efforts mankind is doing in order that no one is left behind. And is what one feels when one is poor: one actually feels one is unable to become someone different.This is the mental and invisible barrier that frustrates many a noble and well guided effort in our struggle against poverty. We should take this fact into very careful consideration if we are to improve the quality and the effectiveness of our future aid. ",1,2,3,2,3,2,1,0,0,1"Jimmy van de Putte concludes by stating that any UN or government project ought to focus on this first, that is: make those individuals the object of the project, actually feel within themselves that they may become someone different, may improve their station in life!!!",1,1,3,1,3,1,1,0,0,1"I will focus mainly on the first question: How will policies need to be adjusted in different contexts to ensure that they more effectively contribute to leaving no one behind in the achievement of SDG1 and related SDGs? Focus on institutional policy regarding leveraging human capital formation appears an understudied area. This is especially true in the area of intellectual property rights; the property rights by which ideas developed into solutions in the developing nations can traded across the world at Internet speed.Institutional policy here means that these rights aught to 1) be available to developing countries and the millions of educated people there in recent decades and 2) institutional arrangements for facilitating trade at company level with international firms aught to be a priority. The first step, providing the legal framework, is a complex process in itself, but has achieved some success the last decade, especially since several BRICS and non-BRICS countries begin to take the IP issue seriously. Human capital, through knowledge possessed by nationals, is perhaps seen as a creative, inventive force in a service economy context, not simply   ìmanual labor  ù in factories. However, it is mainly the inventive portion   ñ the new ideas   ñ that may be the potential for developing nations and eradication of poverty based on human capital formation and collaboration with the developed world.The second one is much less underdeveloped both in the North and the South, giving many nations a chance to   ìcatch up  ù. Most policies favor industrial manufacturing, through economies of scale (lowering cost but not creating much jobs), or service partnerships, through low cost and creating more jobs. In Sub Sahara Africa for example the #1 sector growth appears to be services and agriculture. Fewer policies make it easy to collaborate using   ìIP leveraged  ù human capital, the only sustainable resource of any country.This complex problem can be studied using experimental economics, where a simplified institutional environment and patent system can be designed and real individuals participating as human   ìsubjects  ù. In my experimental research on markets in patents (technical solutions providing long-term productivity) and coordination between inventors, traders and innovators, the results show that the institutional policy is in fact more important than the patent system policy when it comes to willingness to search for and find a more productive technology (See http://rdcu.be/nWdL). This indicates that how these markets are designed matters at least as much as (in the experiment more than) the work that has been done for decades in establishing the IP systems.Some may say:   ìThese are the problems of the rich  ù. No, it is the problem of anyone wanting to leverage their human capital formation. One result of this work points at the very long time it takes to find the most competitive technology in these experiments. Typically about 30+   ìrounds  ù are needed, in a complex technology area. This can be interpreted as years thus about 30 years to find a competitive technology. If the economic life of a competitive technology on average is about 7 years, and we want some return, let  »s say 3.5y then we have to find this technology in 3.5years. This is then only possible if we do about 8-10 parallel research and development efforts. Only the very largest nations can afford such development, all other nations have to cooperate with each other. This thus means that by cooperating between smaller nations (with respect to IP) the competitive edge of human capital can be realized.Policies to encourage such exchange between developing nations include corporate policy giving incentives to trade the ideas, tax policy with respect to inventive activity and the like.Can this really be applicable to poverty eradication? Yes, as most invention is local, meeting local needs. These firms, collaborating with international firms, will then provide products and service related jobs, leveraging the human capital formation of whole nations!What are some measures that can be uses? A measure of such creativity and cooperation would thus be a measure of long-term sustained development base on human capital. Current measures appear to be limited to IP licensing (IMF stats).Examples of what is illustrated are a rising number of collaborations between firms in African countries and Swiss companies, for example the world  »s first Drone airports in Rwanda as   ìtransportation infrastructure  ù, and collaborative start-up initiatives. One can also say that Safaricom  »s licensing of MPESA technology further advanced in Kenya to Eastern Europe, is such an example.When it comes to policy recommendations, one should therefore look carefully at what institutional policies would encourage the creation of such local firms. Clearly a need for data is always present. The policies rest on the accessibility of IP rights, in this case patents, but the institutional policy of using the technology in cooperation with others is more decisive, one should therefore add that to the policy instruments.",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"ICT are a  very important tool for eradicating poverty, yet some conditions need to be taken into account like the creation of digital trust, the promotion of freedom and the insurance of the right to information. In this sens, the liberalization of the telecomunication sector can f reduce the State Monopoly and facilitate access  of all to ICT. The use of ICT to combat poverty need to be also accompained by other measures such as the adaption of language and the content to the cultural specificities of each countries. Considering that women are the most vulnerable to the poverty, ICT can be invested also in dessimination the culture of gender equality, to enhance women empowerment and to integrate the participatory and territorial approach in all development projects.",1,2,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1"What are some innovative examples of employing data and the data revolution to identify and assess policy needs of those left behind?   Leaving no one behind» requires first that we make sure that we are not leaving people behind simply because we are not properly identifying the poor and vulnerable within countries. The Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) and national multidimensional poverty indices - like those used by Colombia, Armenia or Pakistan   ñ are proving useful tools to complement income poverty measurement. These indices assess the situation of people in multiple dimensions at the same time. The MPI, for example, evaluates the situation of people in 10 indicators in three dimensions   ñ health, education and living standards. When poverty results based on these indices are contrasted with income poverty figures, we find some telling results. Sometimes, results match (at least, more or less). Yet, more often than expected, multidimensional figures are remarkably higher, or vice versa (see Figure 5 at http://www.ophi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Global-MPI-2016-8-pager.pdf for disparities within African countries, for example). More importantly, in many cases only a fraction of people will be identified as poor by both methods (so not even choosing the method that yields higher poverty rates guarantees leaving no one behind). This implies that one type or the other of people living in poverty will be left behind from policy considerations if we assess poverty strictly from one angle. The use of both poverty methods at the same time to properly identify the needs of those living in poverty (income poor and multidimensionally poor; non-income poor yet multidimensionally poor; etc.) is thus an innovative example of how data and new methodologies can be used to improve policies and make sure no one is really left behind.",1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
