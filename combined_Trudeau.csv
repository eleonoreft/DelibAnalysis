Thank You for proposing such platform to hear and help every one in the country! There are many people who r eager to start small or large bussinesses . The only obstacle on their way is that they Donot know HOW!    I believe related education or coaching institution should b created that fulfill the gap of lack of knowledge for everyone and make bussiness decision easy for all those who wants to and can make a difference!.I believe if Govt focussed more on educating people on how to do and go about this issue! They will b amazed with the results and jobs would b created automatically..! Lets make bussiness knowledge b as common as ABC for any person...Thank You!HiRent is getting out handHi."people who pay bills, are loaded with pills, nerve pills, tax bills."You killed the countryYour thoughts to help new immigrants were good and kind however they are taking those incentives and not working because they are getting money for doing nothing meanwhile hardworking middle class Canadians keep working hard end up paying taxes and basically cannot afford anything.

Like it or not, fossil fuels will be the worlds fuel of choice for the foreseeable future, even with the increased use of alternatives. Why is it an either/or argument? its a BOTH argument.

It is rediculous that people are having to chose  or hato have hydro or eat or have heat. We are taxed to death literally in Ontario. We were told that we have to cut back myself I have done everything to cut back and my hydro bills keep rising as do my heating costs with the delivery charges. We have got a large amount of Wind Turbins just in the Perth and Huron county alone which should be reducing our cost instead of raising them. If we are now being forced to heat our homes with electricity you will be freezing people to death.

Everyone is complaining about different issues that affects the one`s life. What most are sharing here are symptoms of root problems. If you really think there is only one very common symptom that many express in different ways. The problems are not the high prices, the problem is that we do not have enough income. Who would care to pay the current prices of everything if there was enough left to live a comfortable life and save for retirement? I am sure the majority of us would not complain about the price of dental care if there was enough money to cover it? Mr Trudeau, please research and answer my question: why the majority of Canadians do not have enough income to live a comfortable life and save for retirement?

There are French speaking families who would love to send their children to English schools. There are immigrants who would love to send their children to French immersion in English schools.  Most importantly there are teens who are attending class d'accueil French classes that teach nothing but French for two years; these teens don't learn enough French to be able to succeed at secondary or university classes.  To oblige those who don't know English to study in French may be acceptable, but to oblige Anglophone or English educated teens to study in French is not only heartless and discouraging it is also abortive  on a national level as we  fail to develop them to their full potential.  16 year olds can quit school and they will certainly be more likely to do so when discouraged from trying to study in a language they cannot write well.

Finally someone who understands and cares about our needs. You are on the right track and fixing the mess that's been made over the years. All I ask is for more medical professionals and to somehow make necessary prescription medication more affordable. If you can get those big money hungry pharmaceutical companies to have a freeze on how much they can charge, perhaps those needing medicine in this country won't feel they have to choose between food or medicine, rent or medicine, heat and power or medicine. I think it should be more a priority for those who have worked all their lives as middle class, struggling all through the years to get by and now in retirement years have to suffer without proper medication and health care rather than giving our hard earned tax dollars so someone has a place to illegally get high. I don't work to pay for someone else's illegal activity or for their thrill to party and get buzzed when I can barely put food on my table and pay the rent let alone prescription medication or over the counter medications.

No hydro = no heat, water and yes NO TOILET in a rural community with no municipal services.I served my country proudly for 15 years now suffering severe PTSD and unable to hold a job, provide for my family, let alone give my children a Christmas....tell me sir how am I not to become a bitter disgruntled and likely soon to be homeless suicidal veteran...yet another statistic?"Alicia GastCindy Barnett"ok here we go , the seniors , which i am . is it possible to come to saint johnnb canada , i am 71, unable to walk well because of hips knees and back . will not operate on any of them . i took care of decesed husband lost his income when passed away 5 yrs ago , i had to buy a mini home to keep him with me , no nursing home . home had to go in my name . now i can not keep it , my income is 1, 755.with 2 morgeses and all ins and living costs i have to sell ? if i go to housing i will not be hapy with centre of town appts , scared to death in order to be safe and affordable it has to be in town but not up town m can not afford bus pass for handi bus , or gas , its tight , i have more to say but not on here , i would like to  let you know what we are up against whit all below poverty line incomes . its not fare and you would not want your mother in this position , most of us could not prepare for saving money . befor i could bring my husband home from hospital in a come i had to use all our savings and rrsps left me with nothing  the following year spouse was allowed half ,i lost out on that , some of us need help with drug plan for meds health needs to get along , just like the welfare does for younger people who have much more , etc  ,hope this is helpful""Justin, obviously the investments your own and previous liberal governments have made in some Provinces in Canada, especially in Ontario under Kathleen Wynne, and in BC under it's ex-premier Gordon Campbell never were deserved or entirely needed.   Those provinces still take transfer payments they did not need but waste.   All the most insane and immoral and unethical legislation passed has been in reaction to errant court judgements that the Liberals in the Senate and on the Supreme Court or Ontario or BC Courts of Appeal wanted.   They want so many ""libertarian"" rights they don't need and have been excessively funded without any return of dutiful responsibility toward Alberta for decades - none to Alberta and other farming and oil producing provinces workers who have truly worked harder than any of you bureaucrats, while frugally being responsible and environmentally correct, and making wise donations to truly charitable organizations that benefit all Canadians poorest and those of other Nations also.  Liberals have wasted so much on themselves in the east and in BC and you ignore Canadians in Alberta.   That's why you are only getting applause from your own choir that you are wasting your breath preaching to - start taxing the carbon dioxide that comes out of your mouth when you talk too much.""Hello mister prime minister.There are two things my fiancí© and I need right now. First of all, I need work. Sure , lots of places are hiring, but they're only hiring certain skill levels and there are far too many people out of work for that to apply to me. Job creation in Alberta would be wonderful.Second of all, there is a section of the government called mvar. If you do not pay mvar, your license can be revoked across Canada. You also can't claim bankruptcy to avoid it. We have a 240k outstanding debt with them. They have us capped on the amount they take from us, and because of that we may not be able to buy a home, or even start a family, let alone get married. So tell me, how is one supposed to start a life for themselves with something like this hanging over their head? Mister prime minister, what I'm asking, is there needs to be a cap in place on the amount a person can sue for based off the injury. My fiancí© was the only one hospitalized in this situation, but he was the one who was sued. The other woman claimed fear in her child of vehicles and a minor back injury that prevented her from lifting the vacuum at home. But she has managed to get over 250k from him. Something like that should be capped out, and you need to lower the amount the government can take monthly, as in cases like ours, we're paying out 250 a month on top of child support and another lawsuit. When a person makes a little over 50k a year and still has a multitude of other bills to pay, this makes life beyond difficult. We need help. Only you can help. Will you, is the question."Lovevuuu forevercanadaShellorna Sooley™ƒø±ø_øÂBí©ní©dicte Aitcin BellevilleLH DafonsecaMauroLove u canadaHannah Marie LawsonChloe"Practice what you are preaching!1)  If you plan on phasing out oil sands from Alberta, how exactly did you get to your tax funded vacation in the Bahamas, with all the other Liberals that went on your family vacation? Who paid for the cost of the fuel?  Where did the fuel come from, which country, has better environmental legislation than Canada that you choose to fill up the plane?Why not explore Canada and give some vacation spending dollars back to hard working Canadians?2) What kind of bulbs are in your home?  Do you run your dishwasher after peak hours? 3) Why should my career path of 20 years warrant me to be taxed at a higher rate so it can be then given to those that are just learning their trade, or professional career? Why should a grandmother need to work 75 hours a week to pay a $1,000 per month electrical bill?  I have continued to educate myself to further my career path, it is now being taken away from my by extra taxes.  4)  How exactly have you cut your carbon footprint?  All your choices are clearly lacking leadership to what you are trying to implement.She asked:  äóìI make $50,000 a year Mr. Trudeau and I am living in energy poverty,äó the woman said through tears. äóìPlease tell me how are you going to fix that for me and all of us in rural Ontario?äóYou answered:  äóìWe are a country in which anyone with a quarter of your strength, of your drive should be thriving and focused on how are you going to spoil your grandchildren with all of your energy as opposed to how are you going to get through the week or the day,äó Trudeau said."Jake Ross"As someone who always liked the liberals I am really starting to second guess my choice to support them any longer. With Canada striving for tourism, families looking for affordable vacation within our own country and the government wanting to increase protection of parks and off road recreation how in the world is increasing taxes 300% overnight to Mom and Pop campgrounds going to help? 99% of campgrounds are run by Mom and Pop shops not large corporations, this tax is going to 1. Bankrupt or force the closure of many campgrounds across the country Or 2. Increase the rates to families so they can afford to stay open or force families and Canadians to head south and give their money to Trump and the USA. Keep money, keep jobs, keep families together, in Canada by appealing this ridiculous decision. People are stressed to their max, mentally and financially and camping provides a great, affordable outlet for many. I really hope that as a family man and a Canadian, you will see what a great effect this will have. As a campground owner this won't only effect how I vote in the future and how many of our campers will vote when they learn the Liberals are behind this but I can also tell you as a young entrepreneur small business person that this will likely put a nail in the coffin for many of us. Disappointed on so many levels right now!""Monsieur le Premier Ministre, le prix des assurances voitures en Ontario est tríÂs cher, pas le plus cher au Canada mais le plus cher au monde.

This fact pushes women to quit their job to stay home to raise kids and depends on their men. This is obviously impacting the economy to see women quitting their job and doesn't resolve the issue of equality between men and women.Car insurance and daycare are affordable in Quebec , why not in Ontario?Please make a change to make families better here too"Wyrjshfuwttusjdgfhcvvjxgxjxbcjsyfbcvhdievbxhdgdjjxvxgdchxnshdjduehbbchdjdhdjdhxbbcudieywituwjtnxbbdidhdyedjjxbcbzbxncnmjskfhcbdudjfhsifhcbchdjjsgbxjsuwjfbcbxncbxbcvxjjshfurirywirbbxvxnzgdjfuwifydbbxgduwbxbcvxnnzbxmmskfhjsudhnxuwomfhdlfbfnxncbslfnchsmmxbxjsufjw7djndMeredith Fayhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qYCEGtMdORUAhssan Al ShaalanWhat's world war three stop lyingTebeen Sofy bymzhaNeed to hear this conversation again.

As a Canadian citizen of 62 years, a business owner of 30 years I would like to know why the Cnd. Embassy in Havana tried to discriminate against us because we work as children's entertainers? I had an Approved URGENT LMIA (finances approved) yet my letter from my bank manager and investment company was not believed at the Cnd. Embassy in Havana ! Five months later the TFW was discriminated against by gender which is against the law in Canada ! They based their ruling on their own assumptions instead of the true facts.  I had to take the original documents to the interview and the only way I got to talk to the officer was because I had an e-mail from your office Justin Trudeau that I wrote on and handed through the gates to the security guard at the Cuban entrance. At the Cnd. gate I was told to e-mail them ! My character was portrayed in a negative way when I was treated like a criminal although I had done nothing wrong. My MP's office told me the TFW passed his interview and no more documents needed. Two days later they rejected him for such lame reasons as ""never travelled outside the country before.""  Emotional abuse to the Cuban ! Why can the immigration officer not be held accountable for her shameful treatment to Canadians and Cubans? Everyone I have talked to have been horrified at the treatment of Canadians and Cubans at the Embassy in Havana. We have been hearing what you have to say about immigration lately, and are aware of the cabinet shuffle so we hope the treatment towards Cubans and Canadians is humane and will improve in the future.

If you really care about Canadians, then let us communicate directly with you without having to jump through hoops to do it. #1 build a government website where voters can actually vote on issues without having to leave their house, wait in line for an hour, waste their entire evening when all they want is to have roads without pot holes in them or a better education for their children. 95% of issues can be dealt with online with only a few clicks. It's an easy an inexpensive fix that will increase voting efficiency, voter turn out, and in the long run will save Canadian tax payers millions of dollars. #2 Free nation wide wifi. duh.

Just give it to us already. Kids today would rather die than go without their phone, so that means that our data connections are just as important, or more to some people, as healthcare, electoral reform, Donald Trump and all the other issues you've been talking about today.

Stop allowing 1 in 4 Canadians to be misdiagnosed and labelled as ""crazy"" and mistreated with neurotoxic drugs known for 40 years to cause brain injury, suicide, homicide, death and every disability known to human kind. By law misdiagnosis is insurance fraud and medical malpractice. Legal informed consent cannot be garnered under misinformation or fraud. Full informed consent includes informing a person that all psychotropic drugs are neurotoxic, that there is no evidence that they are ""mentally ill"", that the drugs can kill them and that there are safe effective alternatives, like exercise. New studies show that ""depression"" is cause by stress, inflammation, wrong diet and lifestyle. Start supporting REAL health that has nothing to do with allopathic drugs which by definition cure nothing, suppress symptoms and cause chronic health problems that allopathic drugs are incapable of curing.

The Canadian Medical Protective Association is a 3-billion-dollar tax payers FUND (not insurance) to block injured and killed Canadians from getting compensated in Courts of law across this country. They cannot even get legal aid. Drs are paid a free windfall of money when they maim or kill us while we are relegated to the welfare system. Is this a system work fighting for? Only if you work in it.""How about you step down. You want to step away from fossil fuels and face them out. Your a stupid person and financially screwing me over. You deflect direct questions because you don't have answers, you blame pass government in a failing attempt to relieve pressure on your self instead of find resource or solutions to somewhat fix the current situation.

How much is this costing? We have poor low income families and seniors who need affordable housing. That need descent  food prices not gouging. Food prices in BC is 1/2 or more costing than the east.  I pay 90% of my disability on rent, I have to go to the food bank every month. Every year every thing goes up except the seniors  benefits. It's a slap in the face. Every month you have to beg and negotiate with the utility company's so you can lead a half descent  life. While your going across Canada go into the shelters at meal time and bed time talk to the staff. See the low income seniors and families that have to use the facilities. Go to the food banks and see the people lining up for food that the grocery stores donate only because they can't sell the expired food or soon to be expired. It's the working poor that's the back bone of this country the ones who are doing the jobs that no one wants as it doesn't pay $20.00 an hour. The seniors that have to get a part time job because they can't afford to live on their disabilities. They are the people who clean up at fast food places the greeters at Walmart. Please open your eyes and ears. You want this country to be great so you can boast to the world what a great job the Liberals are doing then correct the affordable housing, the cost of food. There are Canadians that are living as if they are in third world countries. Kids going hungry, seniors having to choose from food or medicine. We have LOW INCOME in this country not just middle class like you keep saying.  Try living on poverty wages. I challenge you too. Your family will never know what it's like nor your grandchildren. You could clean up all the problems in this country.

I appreciate your hard work and I wish you could start to pay attention to the Education too. Just I found out that Moslem people requesting to teach the Koran and Pray in the school that people same as me and my children that we run away from it to this great country Canada. We live as multicultural people in peace and we want to be this way as long as we live. Pushing pray and study the Koran book of the Moslem's people in the school that majority does not want this kind of force by group of Moslem people would be the biggest mistake in Canada. In Constitution of Canada it is very clear that any book that encouraging to Races-sum, Killing, hate others, and against other believes. I am bagging you to read the Koran and see how much this book encouraging all above mentioned. Just hearing the good worlds from people about it would not be the fact and I believe Ministry of  Education shall study the issue and after make a decision. To have more Moslem in your party does not make the Islam is good and goodness is coming from hearts of the person not from believe to their book (they already run away from their country to Canada because of it). If it would be the book guide them they wonäó»t be even working in this country. I am bagging you to read the book of Koran and found out what is the reality about this book. You have to read it with proper translation and see how much hate is in this book about non Moslem people.

Why do we have a federal government? Like an old refrigerator, your outdated, in need of an overhaul, and eat up resources. The only thing you are good for is vacations, selfies and giving our hard earned money away to other countries. You import people knowing full well that we don't have the jobs, resources or housing for all these new people. We have Canadians that are living in 3rd world conditions. Canadians without clean drinking water, Canadians living without heat, Canadians living without hydro, child and senior poverty is on the rise. What exactly is it that the federal government does, besides waste money? You told a disabled Canadian that her issues were with the provincial liberal government, you passed the buck!!! This tour of yours is supposed to be a listening tour, yet you don't listen. If the only things you are going to do is waste our money, tax us more, give our money away to other people and totally and completely ignore CANADIAN issues why do we need you? You rarely show up to your job! You should be there every day, 5 days a week. Here's a news flash for you, the provinces are made up of CANADIAN citizens, CANADIAN voters, you should be doing something to help out the people in the different provinces, because if you aren't helping Canadians, then you aren't doing your job. Mz Wynne stole our money, in Ontario and used that money to promote you when you were campaigning. Mz Wynne is a liberal, as you know, and the 2 of you are very cozy with each other.

Foreign big money is coming into the country and the sky is the limit in these rediculas bidding wars with payments made in cash. This is both off shore residents as well as new residents in our own country.In my own neibourhood the signs are not even up on lawns. The houses are sold in one day up to a week. The sell is usually by several thousands sometimes up to $ 100, OOO above asking price. New subdivisions selling up to 12 homes to one person because they have the cash and are paying over the set amounts. Some for flipping, some for renting out, some for their own extended family members.  This person was foreign, had the cash, out bidd everyone in line waiting to bid on these homes over a weekend. Paid thousands for someone to stay at front of line for them to hold their place in line until the developer opened their doors to sell to the public. Many were turned away from that line shortly after for there was no home inventory left to sell. This is just one example of what us happening in our country.Real Estate agents are fueling these practices even more. They are making much grander commissions on these high priced sales that are going out of control.  They now put post sale ads on their signs saying "" Sold for......$$$$, over the asking price"". People see these ads, of course the want the same or more for their own homes that now they want to sell for these large amounts and make a profit hopefully. Again fueling the greed behind property values and prices.The point is there is no checks and balances on these practices. No laws to stop or slow down the inflation on homes, 15% foreign ownership tax or fees is a drop in the bucket and won't actually stop the run away prices of property.Canadian born youth, families and university graduates are funding it pretty near impossible to enter the housing market. It is slowly but surely reaching a crises for them within anywhere near the city of Toronto and Vancouver especially and up to 100 km radius. There is no security in careers, mostly being part-time or short term to carry the exposes of home ownership plus utilities plus food plus everyday living expesses.  These young people are also carring dept, student loans, first car to get to work by loans, credit card dept just to get gas, clothing, foot wear, etc.Something really needs to be done in youth, young adult despar and growing by the week."http://www.plugndrive.ca/electric-cars-available-in-canada"Mr Prime Minister, with all due respect you ignored the plight of a woman working 75 hours a week with hydro bills skyrocketing.

While I understand it may be difficult, as this investigation involves the very person who ultimately controls your employment... we need you to be strong, persevere and do your job. 2) PM Trudeau has sold access to himself at fundraisers that bring money into Liberal coffers, attending functions that active lobbyists are paying to attend, to get some time with the PM and other cabinet ministers. THIS MUST STOP. IT WILL NOT STAND.3) PM Trudeau is claiming that he and his family went to the Bahamas for a ""family trip"" that happened to be at the home of an active lobbyist, who receives at Trudeau's discretion millions and millions of OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS every year. While claiming this was a ""family vacation"" he decided to take along another MP and his partner, and the Liberal Party President..... THIS MUST STOP, IT WILL NOT STAND.Even-- if we are to believe (and we don't)- that all of these people- the PM, the Aga Khan, Seamus O'Regan and Anna Gainey, are all really truly close friends and that nothing political was discussed on this trip, and that there was no benefit for the liberal party, and no benefit to the Aga Khan's foundation---- they just wanted to be together for the holidays...... as far fetched as that is--- the optics of this situation are deplorable. All I can imagine is that the PM is really unable to see himself tied to the same rules as every other Canadian. Could he honestly say that in the exact same scenario, but a conservative PM doing this-- he would be OK with it?? Our PM should have the integrity and the intelligence to see how this would be perceived by the Canadian people. Friends or not, he should politely decline such invitations, on the basis of it being a conflict of interest as PM. Since they are friends, the Aga Khan would surely understand.NOW- we hear that he also unethically (illegally?) accepted sponsored travel, by way of the Aga Khan's Helicopter during this same unethical trip.PLEASE, on behalf of the Canadian people, hold this man to account.. he's just over a year into his mandate, and the Canadian people are frustrated and angry. Please do right by us.""Enleví© la loi des ambulances fait dix ans je paye des mí©dicaments que j'aurais díé avoir eu en injection gratuits ...

""The Egyptian parliament"" this is nothing but a docile arm shall be stamped approval on everything that he wants the repressive military regime of Gen. al-Sisi to trample on the fundamental rights of the Egyptian people.Should the Canadian people realize that the planned visit of the ""members of the Canadian Parliament"" will be exploited by the military regime to legitimize his positions and policies in the eyes of the Egyptian people and they will be used to give credibility to the system and brutal.The Egyptian parliament came as a product of the military coup and in a political climate where non-existent freedom of assembly or freedom of the media, and the campus of the main opposition party from participating because its members were in detention. And it held this fake parliament, while parliament speaker remains freely elected for the first time since the coup detained along with Aktrmen hundred and sixty other members in very difficult conditions resulted in the deaths of four members of parliament in prison.The Sisi Parliament, which is visited by deputies Canadian and imparts legitimacy to visit them had ratified the hundreds of laws imposed by Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in the period following the military coup against the first democratically elected president in Egypt, the aim of these laws, mainly to strengthen the state apparatus repressive and eliminate the fundamental rights of the citizen .Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have documented the presence of more than forty thousand political prisoners languishing in jails in the state in which became a torture, rape and forced disappearances of things systematic.She described the organization Human Rights Watch, a fourth massacre committed by the military and security forces, which are not subjected to any one of them accountable so far, the worst massacre in the history of modern Egypt.While Sisi continues to impose itself as a trusted partner for the West, especially in the field of combating terrorism and extremism. In fact, his failure appeared not only politically, but socially by seeking to divide the Egyptian society and to encourage sectarian rhetoric, and seemed not to economically and militarily efficiency equally ..Based on the values äó†äó†we believe in democracy together and need to adhere to human rights and the rule of law, we call on the Government of Canada to review its overall policy towards Egypt and seeks to do two things urgently:First, pressure on the Egyptian army immediately to stop human rights violations and the release of all political prisoners, and to ensure the cessation of torture, rape, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions and stop the killing to include cases of executions and extrajudicial killings immediately.Secondly, the payment with full force in order to restore democracy and to demand the lifting of all the controls on the media and freedom of assembly and demonstrationWe believe that democracy is the only way to achieve political stability and we believe that the failure of Canada to stand in front of the repressive regime that destroyed the democratic experiment in Egypt will lead eventually to convince more people of the Middle East to end the repression will not be achieved through democratic means and not in line with the interests Bank."The rest of the Globe does not cater to anyone they use their Resources to build up their Countries"The Canadian Government would be nothing to me at this point in time but a Kidnapper,Torturer and Thief."Pretending that a Third World War was not nearly started out of Spite and Greed will not change the fact that it happenedHomosexuality in my and many people's OPINIONS is a Mental Illness and giving the Psychiatric Patients the keys to a Country is likely not a good idea."I really believe JT that you need to work to raising the living standards of Canadians I can't seeing someone on the street in Canada it's just shows you the wealth imba in this country you either the really rich or poor the middle class after expenses is also left with little like what gives the right to those travelling 10 times a year and those who can't afford to travel once a year really all I see is expenses rising on a bi weekly basis and income/wages stays the same my only concern is that people should all have a fair share poverty should be immediately combated.  Plus more monitoring for non profit organization especially charities where is that money going? If you count the non profit charities you probably have over 10000 each one makes over a million if I was the one in government I will make sure all the poor had a home over 1 billion raised from these non profit charities and people still on the streets that tells me that there is alot of corruption in those organizations and monitoring them must be taken seriously people aren't donating money for nothing we want to see the poor off the streets and healthy.  I can't believe 170 years and we still seeing people begging"Hi                                                                                                                          Not to be mean to Justin Trudeau and his team but why can they not spend time and money helping the individuals that work for him than going on trips or spending money on other countries? When individuals have not been paid in over a year because of the Phoenix System. With this going on and it took almost 3 years to give us a new contract. I personally would think more than once in voting liberal again. It is the same thing every time the Govt's get elected they care more about everything else but the people that do the work for them. This had been happening Gov't after Gov't in every election over and over again."Its the sky high rents 1400 for a 1 bedroom apt? or maybe its the 1 million price housing market in the GTA? oh wait....lets compare how lucky we are to 3rd world countries as some of the libs here have done! Ever think that Trudeau's job is to take care of US! OUR CANADIANS FIRST? not tax the rich to give our money billions and billions to other countries first!? oh maybe that's why i'm 40, unable to afford children because i have to pay high rent, and work hard just for rent and food. Rent, food, Clothing, Car, Gas, Bills at the end of it i'm left with nothing. I'm working not depending on welfare....but if it continues i might end up in deep depression unable to work. So please start thinking of Canadians first and poor that money onto us....I realize i may never afford a house as I do not have parents that will ""WILL"" IT TO ME so i'm one of the unlucky canadian women that I cannot afford a 1,000,000 dollar small townhouse."Security certificates should be eradicated. The supreme CRT of Canada has found it to be unconstitutional yet with a few changes all the practices are still being used. Implementing an attorney who surely does not have the individual's best interest"Build a Great Wall to keep U.S. citizens fleeing the despair of Trump out of Canada. Force the U.S. pay for it. Make Canada Great Again.(In all seriousness, I hope that Canada will stand with other nations of our planet in standing up against the tyranny that is the Trump administration.)"I am being held by the Money which they have taken Control of and won't get their hands off. I am calling all Muslims to help get me out of here alive. I want to go to Saudi or Dubai to live where at least I will be safe and able to eat etc.How about attending Donald Trump Inauguration.... very disappointed in your leadership you should know it will have long term reprocucussions for us as Canadians._ôÖšhttps://www.facebook.com/colettedumont.christianbouffard/videos/1097788840281186/Please stand up to Donald Trump as your father surely would have and show the world that Canada respects and promotes democratic values and decency in national and international relationships."Come visit us on the lower north shore of Quebec. We need road out of here. Only area of.

Election reform, affordable post-secondary education, green energy, legalization of marijuana, and don't bend over for Trump.""Serve us better? I didn't realize the government was designed to serve the people at all based on how it's performed during my lifetime. Here's a few things you can start doing to make our lives better, if you're even actually listening.Step 1: Legalize cannabis already. Seriously, we're up to our eyeballs in debt and this alone will bring in billions of dollars through tax revenue. Also, divert all law enforcement and judicial funding and efforts away from prosecuting cannabis related crimes and get people that have been serving time for it out of the system. Enforcing these laws is a waste of time and money when people are slinging pills to children, overdosing on Fentanyl, and committing crimes to fuel their methamphetamine addictions. Step 2: Fire and/or charge everyone responsible for the obscene hydro rates in Ontario as criminally negligent and make an example out of them. It's NOT okay to fleece the public out of money because of mistakes YOUR COLLEAGUES made. I've paid a debt retirement charge for a debt I had nothing to do with. Half of my bills are delivery fees but the service never gets any better or more stable. Businesses can't afford to start up or stay open and families are going without just to keep the lights and heat on. It's disgusting. We pay the highest rates in the country and we're sick of it. Step 3: Stop negotiating and reverse trade deals with foreign countries that sap jobs and resources from Canada for pennies on the dollar, and quit allowing foreign investors to buy up all of our corporations and real estate. Companies that were once proudly Canadian such as CN, Tim Horton's, Eaton's, ATI and countless others have been acquired by foreign corporations and in some cases closed, and the money and jobs sucked out of our economy. The reason house prices in places like Vancouver and Toronto are so high has a lot to do with foreign real estate investors, who then funnel the income from their properties back out of the country. The city I live in is a sad shell of its former self because of practices like this, and I, along with the rest of the younger generations, have to suffer the consequences, not the people who made it happen.Step 4: You should probably close the gaping loopholes in our laws that allow giant corporations to stash their money in offshore accounts and never be accountable. How many hundreds of billions of dollars have been lost to this? Why is the government's solution to raise MY taxes rather than fix the real problem? Stop allowing corporate interests and big business have such a stranglehold over our government and policies. YOU serve US, start acting like it.Step 5: With all the extra cash you'll have from cannabis taxation and stopping the hemorrhaging of cash from corporate tax evasion, you can afford to lower taxes on smaller and medium sized businesses and offer incentives to create more competition in Canada. This also creates more jobs and helps to lower the astronomical price of some of our goods and services in Canada, as well as encouraging businesses to offer better products to stay more competitive. For example, our cell phone and internet services are obscenely high, and in many areas the higher speed packages aren't even available because companies stash their enormous profits instead of investing in better infrastructure. We can do better than this.Step 6: You'll also be able to afford to subsidize education ever further, if not completely for post-secondary studies, as well as invest more into education all around. Everyone should have the opportunity to to receive a proper education so we can be a more well informed and productive society. As it is, people may or may not go to a good public school simply based on where they can afford to live, and that's not acceptable. Dump as much money as humanly possible into education, there's zero downside.""Justin, you are a babbling puppet who doesn't sound like a leader of a country. When your country needs you the most, you are coming up with fictitious carbon tax and allowing provinces to do the same....this is criminal what you are doing. Instead of coming up with new taxes, why not support Rocco Galati who is the ONLY person fighting for EVERY CANADIAN, but instead you instruct all media outlets NOT to cover the story so the public doesn't stand up and fight together as one so we can defeat the government and overturn the illegal act you father, former Prime Minister of Canada Pierre Trudeau did when he signed on with the Bilderberg group and started borrowing monies with interest from private banks instead of interest free from OUR own Bank of Canada. Since that day in 1974, we as Canadians have watched the national debt increase year over year, to the point where we are today paying OVER $30,000,000,000 in INTEREST every year!!! 30 EFFN BILLION in INTEREST and Pierre Trudeau just like you Justin accepted bribes from the wealthy elites. He sold out Canadians for a nice lifestyle. If your father hadn't made a deal with the Devil, we as Canadians would not know what Carbon tax is, we wouldn't know what GST/HST/PST is because our country would be DEBT FREE!!!

The game has changed and if you want to win another election you need to stop telegraphing your moves. 6) Your emotional intelligence (EQ) is very poor. You demonstrate this very prominently in the House of Commons. There are courses in professional development that could improve your leadership skills drastically. For example when you answer concerns from the opposition with short repetitive remarks without answering the question with any facts or follow up and puff your chest out and then straighten your earpiece and roll your eyes and smirk Canada is watching........and Canadians don't like what we are seeing. 7) Cut back on your holidays, how many vacations do Canadians take each year and how much carbon are you using and abusing? 8) Be fair with your handouts your government seems to support and bailout companies in central Canada. There are some steel, oil and gas companies out west that could use a leg up. The fishing industry in the Maritime provinces could use some help.9) Focus on your country let your family run your charity. 10) Actively listen to everyone's concerns don't just tone them out because their opinions aren't in line with your own. Follow the numbers for example unemployment rates, costs, GDP. All political platforms are dependent on these things if people are out of work the economy is slow, then consider cutting back on your spending and taxes. You ran a very strong campaign on the future of Canadians and then put us on track for the largest debt of all time.""Moi aussi j'ai un agenda íæ pusser, Justin.  Allez ! Je t'invite au chalet !

This job threatening move will open the door to the privatization of Canadian Ports which will end up costing all Canadians.äóìAt every opportunity, this government has shown a complete disregard for the people who work at Canadian Ports and on tankers, bulk carriers, and cargo ships,äó said Ramsey. äóìThe government rammed these changes through the entire legislative process refusing to even hear from the many expert witnesses and stakeholders wanting to address the negative impacts of CETA on Maritime jobs.äóIn the wake of a year that saw no new full-time jobs created in Canada, this government is continuing on with a trade deal that will end 3,000 full-time, good paying jobs without a second thought. On top of the job losses, Canadaäó»s ability to enforce safety and environmental standards will be diminished under CETA.äóìNew Democrats stand in solidarity with Maritime workers across the country and we will continue to fight for their jobs,äó added Ramsey. äóìI am hopeful that the new Minister of International Trade will listen to reason and work to actively defend the high quality Canadians jobs that are at risk under CETA.äó-30-"Bullying and sexual abuse are the main problems in mental health!!!!DON'T HOLD YOUR SECRETS in get help there are help lines!!!

(Greatly reduced for space and time) I used to own one of the factories that supplied Dufferin Games. I was Canada's Biggest true Toy manufacturing company. 100% made in Canada.  I made toys for Presidents CHoice. My own Brand. Private labelled for as many as five other international companies.  Sales in 32 Nations.  So 9/11 hits. I have 17 containers seized at the boarder. that do not get released until AFTER Christmas.   Then I find that my payments for an expensive art project for Lionell trains, Department 56 and more is lost in China as the trade center Liaison office for Chinese PM manufacturing is wiped out. All art lost and all costs thrown onto me, Tens of thousands.   So at the end of the day my company, Canada's only true large toy manufacturer takes a hit in the millions.   What does the Govt do to me. Hits me with a tax bill for $80,000 dollars.  I loose 17 distributors, tens of thousands out of pocket and Millions in future $.  Sooooo I spend years fighting revenue Canada showing I did not get paid. and do not owe the taxes.  By the time it is over I then prove I did not owe the $.  Ohh but Revenue Canada hits me with a $50,000 bill for interest and penalties. THis is for money I proved I did not owe them.  Years more fighting and they garnishee everything and put my company out of business.  Dufferin goes under costing thousands of Jobs I go under costing many more jobs. All the money I used to bring into Canada stops coming in etc etc.   Why did this all happen. Pfhhh who knows.  My conclusion is Revenue Canada is seriously broken.    I do not like Trump but at least he gets what it is like to do business.  No one here gets it. Especially our Govt's  <Yes Plural. It did not matter who was in power they both screwed me.   I am currently just finishing paying off my debt.  I was down to my last $4000 owed.  So what does Revenue Canada do to me.  Garnishees my wage just before Christmas.  Are you kidding me? Over the last $4000?????  Our Govts are not our business friends. They do everything they can to shut down private manufacturing like I had. The only True source of wealth.  I tried every venue I could to show the Govt that they were destroying me. No one cared, there is no mechanism for supporting any business here at all.   The system is broken and so is the country.  We need businessmen in power who get how to make money.  We need Revenue Canada to be accountable and install a better mechanism for disputes. We need Fair and independent mediators.  This alone will save the middle class.""Hi thereHeard you might be able to bring some awareness to how our government is treating our own...When my wife and I got married we each added the other ones last name.

I'm from a country where we could/would not be even able to challenge the system, let alone meet and address such a grievance to the PM.""I thought it was a fair answer.  He spoke directly to the issue.  One may not like the answer - that the transition sucked, we're working on it - but it seemed honest, and sincere.  He should have his feet kept at the fire as this is a governing issue.  The conservatives, if they would have modernized payroll during their tenure -  an entire decade I might ad - then this issue would not even be on the current PM's desk. Why is it that conservatives expect magic from liberals, but accept less than mediocre from their  own representatives. I can definitively say that liberals expect more from their representatives, than they expect from conservatives. The hypocrisy is as thick as  French pea soup.""RULE ONE of computer software systems application is implement new systems in parallel with existing ones, to compare and correct abnormalities.  Someone in government missed that class in Geek 101.""My view towards politics is more centrist (I like some Conservative views and some Liberal views), the one thing I see is that social media never creates anything positive when it comes to politics.  All it does is allow people to hide behind a keyboard and say terrible things to each other.  If the US is any indication, patience, acceptance and understanding seem to be going to the way side.  I really don't want to see the Trump style of politics make it's way into our country but with the constant bombardment, these comment sections are starting to turn into the typical stuff you see on youtube.  What's the point of discussing anything on here if all that people do is yell ""Fake news"", ""Idiot"", Stupid"" and ""You suck"" comments at each other?   Really, what is the point?  Do you feel better after you do that?  Do you feel that you've made your country better?  I doubt it.  I rarely comment on this stuff but it's really a downer to see this kind of response to a guy who is putting it out there and going into town halls to face crowds of people who are not entirely happy.  No one is perfect but it looks like he is trying and that is a lot more than what we usually get in our leaders.""Beg to differ about there being no old system, Prime Minister.  There was an old system but there was also a service delivery model that went along with it, to oversee and validate all the system operations. Your predecessor eliminated more than 500 Compensation Advisor positions.  That was the mistake, not the new system or the old system.  There was no verification, no thought to exceptions and special circumstances and no thought to quality service delivery because we're public servants, so who cares if the non-revenue-generating-overhead gets paid or not, right? His contempt for the public service was well known, but this is black and white proof.   Your first step in a sustainable solution is to reinstate the departmental (not centralized) compensation advisor function, THEN re-deploy an improved Phoenix.  Stop cheaping out like Harper did because in this case, throwing money at the situation CAN solve the problem. I voted for you. Make it happen.  That's your only job, to make your campaign promises happen."Soo now you're concidering a netflix tax?!?! What elese will you find to tax.. You are by far the worst pm ever! You're gonna make us Canadians broke with all of your new taxes!! Please kindly step down we cannot afford to wait until 2020 to kick you out!"I beg to differ Mr. Prime Minister there was an old system and it worked very well employees were paid correctly and in a timely manner.   The problem is twofold the centralization of the pay in Miramichi and the new system should not have been done at the same time.  I don't know who is advising you but obviously it is someone who has a  vested interest in Pheonix continuing as is.  Also, your advisors are not being totally honest with you as you know the system was implemented by Mr. Harper in Miramichi to appease the closing of the gun registry office but there really was no forethought to how it would work.  Obviously, it is not working and the federal public servants are paying the price now.  Mr. Harper did finally get his revenge on the Public Service by implementing a system that does not pay them.""My biggest concern with ALL of this is that pay - employee pay - is being politicized. You can point fingers and blame whomever you want, but in the interim some staff are really suffering, and inabilities to hire will really harm programming and services to the public. Just solve it!! All partie s involved agree that funds are owed, but Phoenix does not have the mechanism to pay them out. There should be somebody sitting in every gov finance office just writing checks until this is resolved, staring immediatley. No more excuses! No more ""cases"" or ""files', counts (which are wildly inaccurate due to a definition that pay is ONLY base pay). Just pay what you owe already! BTW, I am only owed in the four figures, much better off than many of my fellow employees.""Interesting that he is saying 8000 cases yet in our department alone there are hundreds unresolved. I wonder how accurate his figures are. Many haven't received interim pays since February 2016. Furthermore, employees should have never been laid off only to have them scrambling to hire them back and giving them a higher pay grade. What a disaster""I wish as a former comp advisor I was truly allowed to speak my mind !Honestly Mr. Prime Minister, you need to come speak to former Comp Advisors who were WFA'd  and now trying to help fix pay - its heart breaking !""The problem is the old system was people.  Trained human resources staff that the Conservatives laid off to make their bottom line look nice.  The new system was supposed to replace people but the technology falls far short of being able to do that.  If they go back to the old system, they have to hire back most of the people Harper laid off.""I think 8,000 backlog is a huge burden and for someone who is waiting for a paycheck, imagine how a family person wants to serve some food on their plate. it may disrupt public service in your country  and may lost faith with the government.since there is a time frame and a request for emergency funds, I guess this should be a 50-50 compassion to each other to understand both side of the situation. This government is still working round to clock to rectify some backlogs.  that would put faith on each Canadian Citizen.But overall it was answered truthfully and honesty""If it's unacceptable then why did your cabinet minister approve bonuses for the upper management of the Pheonix system?Last time I checked bonuses were set aside for a job well done. You just said it yourself the Pheonix preformance is unacceptable. Maybe that money could have gone to public servants who have lost their homes over this debacle. Could you also do us a favour? Stop saying it's unacceptable when this is brought to your attention we clearly know this. Maybe instead tell us what you're actively doing to fix the problem. Just a thought. Sincerely a public service worker who hopes he gets paid next week,and wishes he had a trust fund to fall back on."Mr. PM Justin Trudeau while phoenix system gets fixed put everyone on the pay system that you and all other politicians are on. Or switch your pay system to phoenix so people are not as frustrated because their leader faces the same issues as them. Quite frankly the problems would disappear very quickly if politicians weren't getting paid on time. #pheonixfallingi believe that the standing committee on gouvernement operations should lay out clear requests and timelines. Also make PSPC executives accountable with consequences of not achieving....how are you going to fix it? assume responsibility is a good first step. now get to work! their is a reason why you were elected! get to work and get it done."Mr Trudeau where is this information coming from? 8000 is no where close to the correct number and how do you ""rate"" the importance of one case to the next? And while the previous system may have had its flaws, please don't discount it. It could skate circles around Phoenix. Just ask the Australian government who dropped it like a hot potato. I don't know of any company who doesn't introduce a new pay system and do parallel runs with the existing system until everything is up and running properly. So please, stop covering up the huge and unacceptable debacle called Phoenix and find a pay system that will work the way it's supposed to. Follow the advice of the experienced Advisors who suggested this over a year ago. Everyone deserves to be paid properly!""If a private company did the same....well Target came into Canada and integrated a new ERP and promptly went out of business due to issues caused by it and the government did nothing.

We will get people talking and paying attention to mental health.  I don't want any more families to have to go through the suicide of a family member or friend.  It leaves a person with a big hole in your heart and life.  My brothers death will not be in vain and I will shout and talk about mental health till we see change.  Anita and I have a cause and despite our own afflictions we will be heard and seen.  Government needs to pay attention to what is going on.Justin Trudeau  I need a job.  Moved back from the US a year ago and still out of work.  I'm a marketing professional with over 15 of experience in both the US and Canada.  Point me in the right direction because I really don't have a clue anymore on how to find a job in this country."What is happening to get compensation from the vendor? The implementation of the system is a disaster, and there's no way the vendor isn't part of the cause. The vendor should be providing compensation that should be passed on to the employees who fell victim, and if the contract didn't stipulate penalties for major issues and non-performance, then something is wrong with the procurement process.""Mr. Trudeau, I am a small business owner and I ship things around the world from overseas. In the past few months, my customers around the world have been seeing record shipping times, while nearly all of my canadian customers are complaining about shipping times. I finally decided to call Canada Post and they told me that the average wait time for items to process through customs is 38 days. THIRTY EIGHT DAYS. Instead of saying that situations are unacceptable, GET TO WORK. We are not paying you to go to the Bahamas with an Imam. There's more to politics than good hair, a pretty face, and empty words, Mr. Prime Minister. Hopefully this dark chapter in Canadian history will be over very soon.""So the answer is: ""No, too bad. You'll continue to suffer while my government takes no action to protect its own employees."" At no point in this 'answer' does Mr. Trudeau actually tell the man who asked the question what if anything the government plans to do to solve this problem. You can't just SAY that something is unacceptable while dancing around a solution.""There WAS an old system! It is called the Regional Pay System. It was operated in DOS, using coding and it was efficient. Yes, on the old side, but working! However, studies were done to migrate RPS to Pheonix... Not the other way around!"Need to get this fixed asap.  It is unacceptable thar there  is someone working for five months with no pay.  And then when they do get paid they are paid for working one hour instead of one week and when corrections are made it is not retroactive to when they started.   Enough already."The solution is simple: employees take their last correct pay cheque to a notary or lawyer and have it signed ensuring its validity, then the government reissues correct amount.  It is not rocket science.""Hi friends! I am Environmental scientist who studied environmental economics...To the Government of Canada and the Government of Alberta:Carbon tax does not work to decrease carbon emissions because you are taxing people on their needs and not on their wants. I need natural gas to heat my home. My thermostat is always set low. Don't tell people to turn their thermostat down when they are not home because it takes even more energy to warm the house back up to a livable level when the do get home. They will use more natural gas by following your instructions.I drive one vehicle. It is a truck. I use it for commuting, for work (as an environmental scientist), for everything. If I were to buy a second vehicle for everyday use and keep the vehicle I need for work, the energy that went into creating that second vehicle (materials / chemicals / transportation etc) would far outweigh any fuel efficiency when I use it over the course of its life. I could drive an electric car, but electricity in Alberta comes from coal (at least until 2030) so driving an electric car is no better than driving a gas powered car. Have they made an electric truck yet that is capable of driving on rural Alberta roads and tracks (mud, snow, ice, up mountains, down mountains etc)?You say I can walk or take the bus. Well... it was -40 with the windchill last week and the Environment Canada website told me it was dangerous to be outside. Should I just ignore those warnings?Here is the deal. Right now... if we don't use fossil fuels we will die. Literally we will die. Burning wood also produces carbon and we would have to clear cut the boreal forest to keep all of our people alive thus removing a carbon sink.A carbon tax is not going to reduce anything right now because we are being taxed on our needs with no other viable options. I still need to get to work in a city where transit is terrible and I would literally have to drive to the transit station to catch a bus or train that might get me to within 4 blocks of my work place (see environment Canada comment above).When will a carbon tax work? When there are alternatives. Maybe after 2030 when coal power is phased out in Alberta and it has been replaced with ????. Maybe when cities have had a chance to expand their transit systems to make them more accessible and affordable.Taxing me for going to visit my family once a year is wrong. Taxing me for keeping my family from freezing to death is wrong. Taxing me for feeding my family (increased costs for food delivery) is wrong. Not only is it wrong, it won't work because for as long as I am able I will continue to do those things. What a carbon tax will do is take away my disposable income. My life if you will. You have taken away my ability to travel. My ability to learn about different cultures. You have taken away my ability to see my family as they live far away. You have taken away my ability to entertain myself because you have taxed necessities. You have taken away my quality of life.I believe strongly in conservation. It is my career. It is my life's work.I voted federally for the liberals and provincially for the NDP. This was not part of the platform and you DO NOT have my support for these taxes.You do not have my support in taxing the necessities in life. Yes, per capita Canada has some of the highest emissions in the world. Of course we do. We are a developed nation in a cold climate. We always will. We need to accept that and move on. If you want to decrease emissions, wait until technology and your people are ready. Educate them on how to do it. Educate them on how to run these new power systems. Invest in these systems. You don't seem to have a problem with debt, so why not?I am angry. Climate change is a thing that we need to address, but we need to address it in an effective way. This tax cannot be effective.In the end, I ask you to go back to the drawing board. To see what you can do to help Canadians maintain and improve in their quality of life while decreasing emissions. If you can find a way to do that, your tenure as government may be longer. That would be a great legacy to leave behind. Let's act and lead. Let's not react with whatever catch phrase seemed good at the last climate conference you attended.Thank you for reading,Lindsay""With 2 autistic kids at home, I just need to get paid what I'm owed. They, and my extended family, is suffering trying to get my kids they help they need while I haven't gotten a full paycheck in months.""I am a card carrying Liberal, and a federal civil servant.  I have had a  specific issue (a few thousand dollars) with my pay, since May 2016, that I've been told won't even be looked at until the ""8,000"" others who haven't been properly paid, are taken care of.  This man has a valid point - it's nonsense.""The best way to start a new pay system is to put the politicians on it first. Any problems will be fixed quickly, rest assured!"Empty words do manuals and input later - totally unacceptable and trying to explain your problems to people losing their homes not only sucks but stinks - get it done."Can we make it a law that grocery stores, restaurants and otherwise give unused food to the needy?  Considering the right honorable isn't taking care of our own country.""I understand this is a complicated situation, but I wonder why, if it is true, were managers and above in the Phoenix system given $ bonuses? I look forward to your answer, please and thank you."Then do something about it BLA BLA just fix it and pay the people.  If the private sector would do this they would be charged.  This was not an answer this is not acceptable.I am a life long Liberal and a huge Justin supporter but the Phoenix problem needs immediate fixing. Do not equivocate just fix it or replace it."Centralizing pay has been a complete and utter failure. Full stop. Yes, Phoenix has it's hiccups, all systems do, and considering it is a new system, it's bound to happen. However, the bigger issue is the shifting of paper from one source to another and another until it finally reaches the Pay Centre where they are so completely swamped they can barely breath. If you want to temporarily ""alleviate"" some of the problems, bring back Compensation Advisors to the departments to handle things like being Temporarily Struck Off Strength (TSOS), Retaken On Strength (RTOS), Taken On Strength (TOS), leave transactions and Extra Duty Pay (EDP). By doing this, an employees pay will be stopped in sufficient time to avoid overpayments, pay will be restarted in a timely fashion when an employee returns from Leave Without Pay (LWOP), new employees will receive pay in a timely fashion so as to avoid Emergency Salary Advances (ESA), etc. Mr. Trudeau, if you want to discuss this more, please contact me.""wow...a politician who is accepting responsibility for the problems in his country and not just using words like ""bigly"" and ""I have a plan...and it's a great plan..."" meanwhile, nobody hears a word about this ""great plan""...can't we just BORROW Prime Minister Trudeau...just for a little while?""You made a ton of promises to our vets, but what have you actually fulfilled?

Those responsible should be brought back to fix the issue, those laid off should be called back to help fix the problem.  Actually not paying anyone is not legal.""Saying you are down to 8K cases is not an honest representation of the situation. That's 8K cases of the cases received before July 2016. Countless cases continue to emerge. I have three issues that arose since July 2016 and are not even close to being addressed. If MPs did not receive a pay check for a full month, or many months, I wonder how fast the system would be fixed. Fair answer in some ways, sure. But please be transparent when answering, and not misleading individuals that might not be close to the issue or affected by it (who will know better).""That is leadership personified.

Centralization is not the answer, you're trying to do the same thing with I.T. shared services and it's not working. The services are not shared, they're non existant. Used to be that your local I.T. person could answer and help you quickly and correctly. Now you're getting the runaround from people that don't know the particular environment you're in.""I just want to remind people that the Trudeau government inherited this mess from the Harper government. The Harper government fired all the pay advisors and implemented the Phoenix system without keeping the old systems working in case of a glitch. By the time Trudeau's administration got to it, the old system was already dismantled. They have to work with what the Conservatives left behind and to their credit, they are pouring a lot of money into trying to fix the problems as quickly as possible. It's not like they enjoy knowing that people are suffering."Took the question point blank..aired it..and did not reply with some political rhetoric to excuse facts...Accepted that work needs to be done and said will be done.  Now we wait and see if bureaucracy can be changed by one leader."If the liberals can't fix a simple payroll problem after one year in power, how can they fix our major problems i.e. economy .  I have no faith in this government."Sure would be nice to see the issue of Bill c-51 addressed and why nothing has been done to start the process of repealing it."So how do you think the conversation went with Pierre Trudeau , while our PM, with his family friend Aga khan in 1980...about aga starting the aga khan charitable foundation and Canadian tax payers footing the bill....and with justin now claiming khan was a family friend we can certainly see clearly how our politicians work...the apple never falls far from the tree..I think there should be a biggar investigation as to what is going and has gone on involving the aga khan foundation...oh right the ccra is responsible for charities...the same ccra who's officials frequently accepts gifts from company's they are reviewing...KCMP....because it would be rude to tell those company's the law surrounding ""gifts""....as one secretary quoted...""I respectfully comment that the old system was not an Ad Hoc system. It worked and it was reliable. Certainly there were issues, but when problems occurred they could be fixed quickly. I was a Compensation Advisor up until the transition to Phoenix and I am quite sick about the state of the system now. I am also a new statistic that cannot possibly be included in the 8000 outstanding cases. We have been trying to have our voices heard as former Compensation Advisors could help.""To me, that is a none answer. Half the answer was repeating the question back as he went on to say they are continuing to try and resolve it. He mentioned no real time frame nor how they were going about trying to fix it. He just beat around the bush until he said his ""allotted"" amount of words.""Trudeau, you are a disgrace to English Quebec. You should have shown a bit of respect to those English questions you were asked in Sherbrooke Quebec yesterday but you replied back in french. I have no issues with the French language and I am proud to be a Quebecer but the respect you showed yesterday you should put a dirty filthy stinky garbage bag over your head. You should be ashamed of yourself. I was mostly always a liberal all my life but you don't deserve to be MY PRIME MINISTER any more. Let's go Kevin O'Leary!!!!""You were asked when would Phoenix be fixed.  You gave a none answer, you will try to fix.  Try not, do.   While your at it get the OAS system fixed so they don't take 198 months to not respond to an already approved application.  NO FUNDS.""With all the negative comments, derogatory words, I can only guess that these people have been paying way too much attention to American voters.  Time to take the high road folks.  We are Canadians.""Can someone please tell me where I can get the Town Hall tour schedule (city/town names,dates/time), I would like to attend if there is one in Edmonton Alberta, thanks!""Are you listening?  Yes.Are you doing anything to fix the problems people mention?  No.How about a new federal law about business practices.No company will charge more than double what it cost the company to produce.Profit for everyone. Better wages.No more gouging of the citizens.Companies have to spend more to be allowed to charge more.""So, it appears Canadians are just as ignorant about what the office of Prime Minister is empowered to do, as are the Americans, who think their President is the King of the U.S. and can decree any changes become law with the wave of his hand.""What about the 50 000 people in Alberta who lost their jobs, yet you still import oil. You increase taxes, you don't protect are economy, are dollar is at . 77 of the usd. Give your head a shake. You want green use are once growing oil field to make solar energy, invest in Tesla help them expand here. Use hemp to make all those oil products we use, but use the oil we have to make plant's for production on the hemp products.""While your highly paid civil servants complain about their pay system not allowing them their weekly pass into your esteemed 'middle class,' First Nation Peoples for years have had to biol their water because mining companies neglected to clean up after them. And to splash the contaminated water in the faces of  all Canadians you, Mr. pretty boy, are in the sack with an imperial mining company promising they won't be sued for the Mount Polley disaster.""Not good enough. Prime Minister Trudeau, you and the payroll dept. going to save the people's homes that they are losing, thru no fault of their own, didn't answer that. What about health plans not paid for, other needs not  met, working towards fixing the problem is not good enough. These people are employed, guarantee their income with a Credit Unionj, Bank, what ever but get them some pay. You and the MP's are recieving yours,and if you weren't the problem would be solved or another solution would have been put in place, Enough.""I wonder how long it would have taken if the tables were turned and the  Ministers were the ones not getting paid .  As always, it`s the regular everyday workers that  have to pay the price.""Reduce The Hydro Bill, The property Tax, and gas bills at the pumps Free Education -colleges and Universities- increase Minimum wage, find jobs for all those Millennials who graduated with degrees but yet to find a job in their field. hire more Doctors, and nurses. You plans has made rich richer, poor poorer and the the middle hard working class poor.  You fail us all and will never vote for you or your party ever again.""reminiscent of the Obamacare rollout debacle.  Even with all the federal resources available, the sheer scale of some transactions defy efficiency.  Good for that citizen for confronting the PM.  And good that the PM didn't duck the question or pivot to distract.""This is a system that was installed and implement by the previous government, however there must be a definite top priority  placed on correcting the system once and  for all.. Top Priority!"Kyna Daley - guess you're part of the lucky 8000 who still don't get paid your salary - didn't feel satisfied by his answer - didn't commit to anything concrete"I understand canada needs to be better economically.But what other options do we have besides oil and gas...What are we switching to exactly. Can someone please enlighten me on what better options we have?Once again. I agree we need to improve on our consumption. And make better use or it. But.....Whats a better option than oil and gas. Anybody?""It's funny, but the people in the background don't believe a word he's saying,,, and he hasn't had the nads to head west yet,,,""What a great idea to tax Netflix! Feminine hygiene products are taxed, an actual necessity; why not tax an entertainment product? Cant understand why harpo didn't think of that when he was busy promoting it!!""He is all talk no action...i voted for him.and feel ""dupped"" by his political correct show-man-ship!!!!!!!  No longer part of His leadership...just waiting for it to End!!!!!!!!!!"You did a great job today and people were listening to you and you were listening to them. Only the disgruntled Conservatives were upset on line. Maybe they are worried you will bring over some Conservatives who are tire of that party. They sure never had that with Harper. He wouldn't even talk to canadians let alone have a town hall meeting open to all.."I appreciate the subtitles. Thanks! I don't know too much about Phoenix, but I think even though you are taking all the steps possible to rectify it, you admitted that there was overseeing on the Liberals' part. Shouldn't someone take some blame instead of just glossing it over that you are trying your hardest? I understand you are trying hard and you inherited the problem, it's just that it's 8000 too many and if other places like Hong Kong someone is stepping down already. I don't mean you, but like a minister. Like the ODSP problem in Ontario and people getting screwed, it's just not right.""Netflix tax? A tax on money grabbing Carbon Tax? what else are you going to do to bleed money out of Canadians, Bungle Boy?""Sir, I am from Tamil nadu and I thank you in my heart for respecting my culture but in India we do potrest for celebrate the function . The thing we have politicians once like u but not now, thank you for wishing as Thai Pongal in tamil"You're working hard towards resolving this? The call centre doesn't even answer their phones anymore. Employees have nowhere to turn too for answers. It took me 6 months to receive partial payment after leaving the public works. Never again!!!"I am wondering when you will be in Gatineau M. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau . You need to do something about Employment Insurance claims taking so long to be processed. I am currently in that process due to health reasons and week after week, I am told that it will be another week before they process my claim. My payements dont stop accumulating during that time and because of that my health is not improving for me to return to work. Please do something about this."It's stupid they should put interest in that money... this is stupid a lot of family's that are loosing their homes ... his the president and he can't even do anything about it ... what if it was coming out of your pockets M.trudeau . put yourself in ppl's place. Makes me angry that some ppl work hard for their money and have to wait 5-6 months even more before getting a pay ...."I had my name on the list for your visit here in Fredericton today, but regretfully my PTSD got the best of me, and I could not overcome the anxiety of all the people.  What I had wanted to talk about was the Mental Health system in this city/province/country.  NOT just depression, but also anxiety, panic disorders, PTSD, bi-polar, and the list goes on.  It's becoming a huge problem, and no one wants to talk about it.  My friend Christina Gore lost her brother to suicide a couple years ago, she deals with anxiety and depression, I myself deal with PTSD, depression, panic disorder, and anxiety among other health problems.  I personally WAS a patient through Mental Health, and the Dr's changed this past summer...I was told to wait for the new Dr to call  me, and t never happened.  In December I got a letter saying if I didn't contact them by November 24th they were closing my case, no one has answered my 12 phonecalls.  I assist Christina in co-ordinating the Memorial walk for mental health in the name of her brother, where we raise money that goes directly to mental health here in Fredericton.  It is so disheartening that we do all this work and it doing nothing... This is one of the worst times of years for me personally and so  many others.  February 28th marks the 3rd anniversary of my younger brothers murder in Uxbridge Ontario, and it's the most financially stressful time as well...I have been on that edge of taking my own life, and it terrifies me.  That was the whole reason I saught help in the first place.  Those feelings are always there, and are there now, but I fight because of my children.  BUT...I need more help...like SO MANY others!!!  We have stood by tables, trying to talk to people about Mental Health, but the majority put their heads down and hurry away.  Look at the service members taking their own lives...and/or the lives of their families.  Something is very wrong with this system.  It is hard enough for a person with a mental illness to finally ask for help in the first place, but to be put on a waiting list for months, set in a hospital hallway for days, told to see your family Dr because there's nothing they can really do right now...is NOT acceptable.  Throwing medications at people to NUMB them and make them into zombies is NOT HELPING!!!  It just takes away our lives...it seperates us from friends and family because either we are too tired to get out of bed (which increases the depression part by the way), you're too anxious to be around others, or you are that zombie I walked about.  There are many things that need to be fixed within our government systems, and I don't dare get started on all of those, but Mental Health is something that NEEDS YOUR HELP!!!!""This is totally unacceptable , the stress this has caused to those people, not being able to pay their mortgages . Shame on you :-(""am glad to see the PM communicating with the population and taking the hard questions.  I like this compared to the closed/controller we had in office previously.  Sure, he is not perfect, and he may not get everything right, but he is trying.  He is open, he is communicating.  We should be grateful to live in a democracy where we have this.""Phoenix is a sick joke and an insult to all Canadians.  Start cutting heads right now, keep cutting heads until the problem is fixed.  When the overpaid bean counters start smelling the blood in the hallway, they will find the solution.  Do you have any idea how much this is costing you?""What I find unacceptable is that some people haven't been paid since Phoenix came to be.  How can that be?  In corporate Canada, if someone is not paid via the payroll system, employers pay via alternative means (e.g. a manual cheque).  This is outrageous!  Glad to see the PM is manning up rather than placing blame on the government that enacted this system...""Really Justin?  Asking employees to finance a botched payroll  implementation?  By now the Canadian Government should have taken on all of the financial mess.  Pay our employees. Authorize funds to take care of this mess.   And if GoC can't do it internally, authorize interest free loans for those affected with GoC making the principle and interest payments.  Get it done.  Our employees so not have the resources to absorb this mess. Expect jokes about Phoenix rising.""It's amazing how you found all these even-tempered well-spoken people to ask exactly the right questions.... This is depressingly similar to the Harper ""unplanned"" events.""canada need own voice in global oil market,  Alberta do got help from USA in develop oil sands, but canada also give great deal on price, tax, land use , when OPEC  non OPEC cut,  in global oil market,  Asia , euro oil trader buy and bullish on oil always, however, as long as  the turn to USA trader,  only one result , too much oil in the world, sell and bearish,  USA oil trader= oil bearish,  if bearish news not working! sell reserve oil to flooding market,  all Albertan wait for oil up to got a survival job. But your oil use to flooding market to destroy your dream. Albertan need more customers and more weight on  oil price. Average 10 trading days, may be only one day for bullish for USA oil traders."That's no consolation to families who can't pay their mortgage or for their kids activities.   The old patchwork meant that each department took care of their own employees in a reasonable amount of time. And compensation staff were trained and competent. You knew who to go to with questions and got answers right away.  This new system does not work and people have lost faith in it and the government for it.When are you coming to the Prairies?  Liberals have never won a seat here because their main leader doesn't come here. We want to change the  SaskParty but your people needs your help bye.He doesn't care people all he wants is your money so he can blow it on BS. Governments only see Canadian citizens as dollar signs."How noble of Trudeau to say this is unacceptable and that they are working SO hard to fix the problem.  Notice he did not make mention of compensating those involved.  What happens to those who will lose their homes?  Each day he is in power, I lose faith in him and his b.s. election promises.""#PMJustinTrudeau #ConnectingWithCanadians #FocusedOnRightThings #CanadaProudLeadership in action! Minding the nation's business. Building our international reputation, diversifying our market opportunities, building ties and bridges within Canada, with allies and partner nations for future prosperity, security and growth! Well done #PMJustinTrudeau CONs and NDPs despicable rhetoric is embarrassing and shameful by any Canadian measure of decency and human rights!We need good leadership on both sides of the house!

He is just another tax and spend liberal. How in God's name did this man get elected and I wonder how much buyers remorse there is among Canadians?I think Canada needs you for a period of not less than thirty years in order to serve the legacy of conservatives from the mistakes of heavy did not forgiven. Canadian people lucky to have you here today God bless you.We look forward to leading the world soon"How about, until those employees get paid, you, or anyone one working in your office don't get paid? If it wasn't broken, you shouldn't have switched systems.""We've issues with failed IT in BC too.  It seems that the money flows, the investment gets beyond the point of it  being somehow rational to simply let the mess fail, and move-on to a better system-choice. ""If you know you are failing, about to fail, in jeopardy of failing:  FAIL QUICKLY.""  ~ Sir Richard Branson (Paraphrased to drive home the point).  How many of us have pushed something like this, holding up the sky, when the very best choice we could have made was to simply allow the sky to fall, gather the pieces, and move on to something that actually serves us well.""Justin Trudeau and the Transition, although I respect our PM taking responsibility:  this is not the problem.  I'd prefer leadership heads-rolled over this.  Because leadership in our UNELECTED Public Service at the top of the food chain, should be answerable to Canadian Citizens, such as you are demonstrating your own willingness to accept.  Whomever is in charge of this mess?  In leadership?  Should need to come forth publically, and speak to the failings.  If I've missed someone doing that?  Then I stand, willfully, corrected.""Losing homes?  Justin Trudeau:  With no catch-basin, financially, to save families from this?  Are you serious?  What's wrong with our Financial Services Sector in this country, that would allow themselves to go after unpaid Government Workers, as though these families are intentional dead-beats?  You couldn't intervene as a Government and approach our Banks in this country and negotiate grace for our front-line service staff?  From the side-lines, I simply can't respect how this could be allowed to happen for even ONE worker and her family, let alone, given your figure shared, well over 8000?  Is there a true-blue meltdown within leadership on this issue?  Or, is there some Privatized group, waiting in the wings, to swoop in to replace this for profit?  This situation makes no sense.  Although I'm grateful that we live in a country that our Prime Minister of Canada would even open himself up to this question publically:  This citizen heard little boots-on-the-ground consolation offered.  ""People are losing their homes.""  Justin Trudeau:  You did hear that part, yes?"Waiting for three months for severance payment - call centre refuses to assist - says they are contracted to only answer the phone and not take any action to assist - what is that all about?"I am SO proud of our Prime Minister for having open dialogue with people who are upset, angry, and looking for answers. If I could I'd buy Mr. Trudeau a drink. Good job!"when are you coming to NL so I can ask you why you will not enforce the rules of the temporary worker program? I tired of losing work illegally!Please come to Sudbury.  I will show my anger about the social system and how it works to keep disabled people to the sidelines.  I had a darn brain surgery to rid myself of epilepsy and cannot for the life of me get help with job training for a job I can do with fractures in my spine."This refusal to allow the sky to fall, jeopardized the livelihoods of Canadians who serve their fellow Canadians, front-line.Again, I suggest?  We've some leadership issues at THE TOP in our Public Services.""And your dumb Christmas vacation.....I still can't understand why you would do something so stupid as that. I actually thought you knew what you were doing. In the future, if you are unsure about policies.....please ask someone. Don't wait to face consequences."No old system....that's bs...I got paid for 10 years and in May it started with the problems and still waiting. ...not voting for him in the next election.Too many look for complicated solutions to simple problems. May have been adhoc but there were no employees not being paid. There are so many payroll policies and procedures for every province and it just does not make sense to make this into one big system for all. Payroll is an overhead cost. It was much cheaper to process payroll the way it was done before. Many Payroll Supervisors who advised against these huge changes knew in advance the adverse effects these systems would have but they were chalked up to employees adverse to change.  Unfortunately they have taken this on now and they have no trained staff left in local offices with the knowledge needed to take this on. The costs involved have been astronomical up to this point and it would all be for not to turn back now. They need to set up a department that is strictly for screwed up pays. They need to fix this manually for the employees now. They can enter adjustments later. They also need to be prepared to do manual tax slips for the one's that are messed up. Processing as is has so many implications and the nightmares that will cause is going to be incredibly costly.  Far better to be prepared to put together manuals now to ensure that at least those are right. You want those tax slips showing exactly what each employee would have got had all been functioning properly and then you fix it manually to ensure they have all their pay and all the proper taxes have been submitted. You are far better off correcting this properly now or this will be a nightmare year after year to fix it. Far cheaper to get the staff in now to get this problem fixed at the employee level now. Adjusting entries can always be made later when system quirks are corrected."quand le gouvernement viole les droigt du people ,linsurrection est pour le people le plus sacrí©e desdroigt et le plus indispenssable des devoir ...L'insurrection est l'action de s'insurger.

The first thing you are taught in Payroll Management is how important it is to ensure payroll in processed on time and with 100% accuracy. Employers have many expectations of employees that they all must meet in order to stay employed. Employees only have one expectation of the employer. Pay us accurately and on time and there is no excuse to do otherwise. They need to get payroll managers and supervisors back in the loop if they are ever going to solve this issue."I didn't agree with every answer you gave but, these town halls are very important. They are a way for us to bring our concerns directly to you in a transparent way. I appreciate that very much.

We cannot do this anymore in this way.""What is more unacceptable are approving, pipelines the TPP and C51, and lack of electoral reform or legalized Marijuana.

THIS IS SURE SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT!!!!(and to ask your M.L.A. about!) THE ONLY THING WRONG WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S CALCULATION OF AVAILABLE CPP IS THAT THEY FORGOT TO FIGURE IN THE PEOPLE WHO DIED BEFORE THEY EVER COLLECTED A CPP CHEQUE!!!WHERE DID THAT MONEY GO?Remember, not only did you and I contribute to CPP but your employer did, too.  It totalled 15% of your income before taxes.  If you averaged only $30K over your working life, that's close to $220,500.  Read that again.  Did you see where the Government paid in one single penny? We are talking about the money you and your employer put in a Government bank to insure you and I that we would have a retirement cheque from the money we put in, not the Government.  Now they are calling the money we put in an entitlement when we reach the age to take it back.  If you calculate the future invested value of $4,500 per year (yours & your employer's contribution) at a simple 5% interest (less than what the govt. pays on the money that it borrows), after 49 years of working you'd have $892,919.98.If you took out only 3% per year, you'd receive $26,787.60 per year and it would last better than 30 years (until you're 95 if you retire at age 65) and that's with no interest paid on that final amount on deposit!  If you bought an annuity and it paid 4% per year, you'd have a lifetime income of $2,976.40 per month.THE FOLKS IN OTTAWA HAVE PULLED OFF A BIGGER PONZI SCHEME THAN BERNIE MADOFF EVER DID.Entitlement my foot, I paid cash for my CPP!  Just because they borrowed the money for other government spending, doesn't make my benefits some kind of charity or handout!!Remember Senator's benefits? --- free healthcare, outrageous retirement packages, 67 paid holidays, three weeks paid vacation, unlimited paid sick days.  Now that's welfare, and they have the nerve to call my  CPP retirement payments entitlements?They call CPP an entitlement even though most of us have been paying for it all our working lives, and now, when it's time for us to collect, the government is running out of money.  Why did the government borrow from it in the first place?  It was supposed to be in a locked box, not part of the general fund.Sad isn't it?  99% of people won't have the guts to forward this.

Sigrid Griffin. Karen Dyck"If you scroll down all the comments, you can clearly see who Trudeau who is in touch with, and who he is not. There is no grey area. It's in black and white. As all Canadians are seeing now, this is the exact reason I am so critical of Trudeau. It's not a ""con"" thing. It's a "" invest in Canada and less overseas"" thing. This is exactly the same answer Wynne said about Hydro rates. All I keep hearing from Trudeau is the same thing over and over, and nothing is happening, and that is ""the government is working very hard to.."". We have been hearing that for 15 months and nothing is getting done cause all Trudeau cares about is getting a seat in the UN, no matter how much it hurts us in the process. That's my fight. There are a lot of problems within the system that need to be corrected, projects that need to get off a desk and on the ground. Nothing is getting done, and I doubt they will be done. He is an all talk, no action leader that needs a selfie to buy sympathy to get votes for 2019. If we want to crunch numbers, I'm good at that. Let's take the last refugee patch. Out of 37000 that we brought in, 6200 found work, whether part time or full time..Out of 37000. That's near 20% of the refugees found work. Out of those 6200 that have found work, and integrating into our society.  Meaning 80% or 31400 are still living on social assistance. How is this in anyway successful to our economy or integration? The refugee program was untitled we bring in 25000. I'm not complaining we jumped to 37000. However I am complaining that Trudeau wants to bring a lot more, while we still have 80% still unemployed? Instead of bringing even more in, and let countries like Saudi Arabia take any in, which they have not, focus this year on getting projects on the ground, get refugees unemployed down to 40%, before you bring in more? Better yet, very soon a few European countries will end up becoming refugees themselves due to mass migration, who would integrate far better into our society, and would find work? That unemployment will never ever get under 40%, and why? Most men do not want their wives to work, or women aren't used to work because their husbands wouldn't allow it. It's not sexist, it's straight out fact. We brought in more than we agreed upon, it should stop there until you can make that 80% drop to even 40% before you bring in more and see if this is a success or failure. If it fails, very little damage done. Continue with a failed plan, and it could become very damaging, and as everyone knows, which takes only common sense. As unemployment goes up, so does crime. They go as close to hand in hand as Sharia Law is to the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood."Eliane Wardan Maryanna GebraelMary BevillCaitlin Piche Nicole GagnonJonnathon MarconiCindy OrtiRawan Al-MassriMike SingletonHe agrees with the public; people are still mad.

Everything Trudeau posted about his cross-country tour. Why hasn't he put something like this up? This is another reason I ask again, why doesn't he put up full vids of his cross country tour? You would see vids like this. Forget the title, it's a dumb title, but this is stuff that makes Trudeau look much better than he has. It was great. It was a great answer, he wasn't fumbling the answer, it was believable. This is stuff that makes people like myself who thought this tour was lib staged, shows the tour really is open to everyone, and it was a great answer, as long as he follows through on it, but to connect with everyone, full vids would look far better on him than just the best parts for him. He looks far better when answering the opposed.https://youtu.be/50F5IUG3tAE"Sandrine KankolongoBelindahttps://goo.gl/ER50rqSandra KasbeyCarole CouturierAbirami Kanagasekarampillaihttp://debatepost.com/2017/01/16/breaking-trudeau-finally-under-investigation-this-could-be-the-end/"Bonjour Mr Trudeau , j'espíÂre que vous verrez ce vidí©o et que vous aiderais les Aidant naturel qui sont oublií©s par le gouvernement... https://www.facebook.com/iciestrie/videos/1443533225659452/"Amandeep HansClary PetersAlex TuPritpal GillShirley Augustinhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1IawA37r9o"Why is there no mention of the Muslim gang rape on the news?

You are a great statesman, you make Canada look good on the international stage. However as your father did you are creating a great deficit and a great debt for our country. Break from the family tradition, tske care of the people of Canada first. Lower hydro rates (find a way) get rid of this carbon tax."Thank you for making yourself available....it is truly appreciated. I've seen and heard more from you in one year than Mr. Harper in his 10 years.wow at least he takes questions from the news organizations and the people. more politicians should be doing this."You completely deflected the question in 1.5 Trillion in debt!   I heard nothing about creating desperately needed private sector jobs.  Western Canada needs jobs!   We need pipelines approved Energy Easy needs urgent approval.  Ethical and environmentally responsible oil and natural gas is produced in Canada yet you allow oil to be imported from countries that do not even respect human rights!Transfer payments from the West to Quebec need to stop right now!  How is this equitable and fair?   Pls answer this question?"Western Canada needs to separate from Canada! We pay all the bills and get no say on anything. The elections are decided by the East and they get everything Canada sucks!!"The economy led G 20 countries in the 3rd quarter with   2.6% growth. Trudeau is an amazing leader.  It takes guts to face unscreened questions.  Something that the last guy refused to do.  Give him credit. Trudeau is connecting with Canadians and they love him for it. Almost 300,000 children are being lifted out of poverty by our new Canada Child Benefit, which ensures that 9 out of 10 families get more money each month. The middle class tax cut means that nine million Canadians will pay lower taxes for 2016, while the wealthiest 1% will contribute a little more. And  all the provinces joined together to strengthen the Canada Pension Plan.Meanwhile, historic investments in infrastructure and ocean protection are creating good middle class jobs, and helping to build a better Canada for future generations. Lifelong pensions have been returned to veterans.The quintessential leader for all Canadians.""So far, Trudeau has spent his term as PM reversing everything the previous Conservative government did.  Trudeau also spent us into a hole, lied about his vacations, cash for access scandal, doing a fake ""reach out to the people"" tour, he canceled the child fitness benefits, he cancelled children arts credit, textbook tax credit is cancelled, education tax credit is eliminated, he is going to introduce carbon tax....This is only in his first 13 months in office....._ôÖç Good job pretty boy.MAJOR FAIL!"I voted liberal in the last election because we needed change... Harper and his minions actions were criminally questionable. But I have to disagree on phasing out the oil sands.  I believe a balance of different industries would suit Canada best.You are unbelievable & it's sick!! U & your family spent taxpayers $ on your family frickin trips...I've seen all the old interviews with u & what u said about the west!! Now 2 frickin days ago your worst comment ever about the oil sands"Listening to people vent won't solve the issues. Only affirmative action will. Giving power to the provinces, especially Ontario, for cap and trade will put even more people in the poor house just like the woman in London. There are far more out there who can barely afford to eat let alone make their voices heard. Sending money to other countries may be admirable, however when our own citizens have to choose between food or rent or hydro makes us hypocrites. Canada is a great, great country, yet politicians time and again destroy the citizens with taxes, fees and more taxes. Understanding the problem is a first step. Unless you have been there Mr. PM, there is no way to understand the frustrations right now. You do have the authority to make sure we all prosper in Canada. Use it.""This is a comment I read, worthy of sharing ""Ce matin je pense íæ tous les retraití©s qui reí_oivent la pension de la sí©curití© de la vieillesse, pour ceux qui ne le savent pas encore nous aurons une augmentation de 0.57 sous par mois íæ partir de la fin de Janvier , nous recevions 569.95 et nous recevrons 570.52. Durant ce temps líæ le gouvernement Fí©dí©ral dí©pense des milliards pour accueillir des immigrí©s Syriens .

Over 10 percent unemployment and growing?  You will have tough questions to answer here!!!!!!!!!!  You most likely will not stop here, fearing the reception you will receive!!!!!"I can appreciate Conservatives in the room giving a bit of attitude but Zack...it's Prime Minister Trudeau NOT Justin. At a minimum..show some respect."Hey Justin if you want to phase out fossil fuels how are you going to take a helicopter to a private island? It would be a long walk and swim to get there. Or you just want to phase out the Canadian Oil Sands and get oil from other countries that produce higher emissions and carbon? Not sure how your province of Quebec would survive without getting all that money from the western provinces. Also what industry would you put in place to make all the money that our oil sands generate? Canada would be a lot poorer if we had no oil sands. With the high cost of hydro in Ontario there will be alot more automotive plants running south of the border. What is your plan for that? You need to start stepping up and taking care of Canada. That poor lady that has to work 75 hours a week to try and pay her hydro, keep her house and has 68 dollars left for groceries and you tell her hydro is provincial. You sir can do something about that. All these taxes you are putting on everything will ruin this country, people cannot afford this. Maybe if you actually had to work for something in your life you would know what it is like to live paycheque to paycheque but you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth and only got to where you are because of your last name. I hope you are really listening to all the people while you are touring Canada and make the changes that are needed!!""Mr.Trudeau,first of all,I have so much hope and respect for you. As an American,and I speak for millions of us..we have Canadian envy. I didn't vote for trump...I am scared to death of what is happening in my country. All were asking is you don't lump us all together with the the people that did put this maniac in office. We fought hard to stop him,and were still fighting.

Not looking good for Canada - when is the next election and when can we vote a leader who will work for Canadians?"What a joke, his ratings are down so George Soros sends him on a selfie tour to answer hard questions from star gazed soccer moms and young millennials. Can't wait till Kevin jumps in and wins the next election. We need a Trump not another globalist liberal who works for Soros.Ok liberals you've had your turn to make things better and it's an epic fail. Time to elect someone who can tie his own shoes.""Buddy , what do you think you are, Zack  ?? Mr Justin Trudeau is the Head of the Nation. Respect the opinion of the Majority at least if you can't respect him ."You speak very well but really disappointed that you didn't address the real concern of that lady - just said the province is responsible...well the province and hydro decisions are made by Liberals and surely as PM and a Liberal you have some sway with Wynne...she's getting away with wrong!!  Help us in Ontario - because she will not survive the next election..."Justin, you had me as a staunch supporter, but now I sit the fence. I will never vote PC, but this last election I did not vote Green, I voted Liberal, largely because of the appreciation I had for you as a journalist when you were a correspondent for McLeans Magazine. These are my issues:1)You promised electoral reform, but now, maybe not? 2)You said you'd look into C-51, does it look ok? I still don't think so.3)The carbon tax... I would support this wholeheartedly, if there was an economic and viable alternative to what is presently available. How about electric cars? How about supporting off the grid energy? How about supporting more local farmers?4)Keystone... not surprised, you never said you were against it, I was just never for it, and hopeful.""Thanks for replying Jane but all PM's have had an array of staffers thatwould provide them with info without him .having to travel across thecountry at the taxpayers expense. All this,  and yet no changes have beenmade as to what the general feeling of the population is struggling with. Iwill retract my opinion when for once, there are sweeping changes made thatactually mean something to to the average Canadian.""If he's already caught flak for his government's incompetence in Ontario I can only imagine what will happen in the Conservative strong, blue collared West which has taken the biggest beating economically recently. Wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't go to Alberta or B.C at all.""Where's the video of you in Peterborough that's got 1.5 million views last time I looked?!...That woman tore you a new one and all you did was say ""uh uh"", praised her, because you're so empathic and compassionate, while you DANCED around the issues!""Congratulations on being the First Prime Minister to ever be looked into by the Ethic's Committee. Do me a favour and the majority of Canadians who didn't vote for you, RESIGN!!!!!! You are a disgrace to the Office of Prime Minister. You think you are above the law.

But you have not said when it will be fixed, or what the compensation will be for those who have gone without for so very long.  This never should have happened and I certainly hope that your government will not issue bonuses to the executives that allowed this debacle to go on - merely to ensure that they DO get their bonus as the Phoenix roll out met it's projected timelines.

We know the media always look toward the negative and segment out what is going to cause controversy and make money for them but we know what you do is sincere because we know you want to do what is right and yep we all make mistakes. Keep up the good work. Thanks"Deuteronomy 32:1-4 äóì1 Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth. 2 My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass: 3 Because I will publish the name of the _»_î_´_î: ascribe ye greatness unto our Elohim. 4 He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a Elohim of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.äó""Well done Sir, You must go alone to meet people & learn more & earn leadership. It is something which cannot be learned from books, Unlocking people's potential to become better is your task  Growth & development of your people is the highest calling of a great leader. It is being done by you in an excellent manner. Keep up your good work. Thanks.""I am disappointed that you are trying to understand what Canadians want after being elected, should that have not been done beforehand?  I am hearing the same things from ""the Streets"" no matter who is in power for years, and if I hear it, how come you or your predecessors  don't get it yet? Like a town hall meeting with pre-approved questions and guest will make a difference. Stop taxing us to death to support a failing bureaucratic system that continues to operate in a deficit. The middle class is drowning and working harder than ever to survive the outrages hydro bills, increases in food costs and yes once again, the taxes.""About UsThe Canadian Coalition of Concerned Citizens (CCCC) is an advocacy group comprised of men and women from all walks of life. Every concerned Canadian citizen is welcomed to join our movement and share their ideas with us on our web-site. The mission of the CCCC is to tackle important social issues that are currently affecting Canadians by (1) addressing the specific issue, (2) researching the existing pertinent data, (3) discussing and proposing ideas, and (4) putting forth effective common-sense solutions to hopefully direct policies at all levels of government. By joining our voices together, we can ultimately guide the future of Canada!  Overview of some CCCC Talking Points - Reduce the number of tax brackets and introduce a fairer rate specific to the lower, middle, and upper class groups in our society.- Introduce a flat tax rate specific to small, medium, and large-sized businesses.  - Collect royalties from all our national resources and share the income with all Canadians citizens.- Protect Canadian manufacturers by placing an international tariff on similar foreign-made products entering the Canadian market.  - Abolish the federal sales tax (GST) on Canadian-made goods and services.- Eliminate all unprofitable, unnecessary, and redundant governmental offices and positions.- Institute visitor fees in all health care institutions. - Prohibit all Canadian political parties from receiving foreign donations.- Shut down and disband any organization which preaches against the Canadian Constitution, laws, and values.- Open immigration channels to any person who can immediately integrate, assimilate, and contribute to the Canadian economy and life-style.- Modernize the complete Canadian military system and its personnel. - Ensure that Canadian social services provide daily lodging, sustenance, and support for the homeless.- Develop governmental programs to establish affordable schools, colleges, and universities for all Canadian citizens.- Create online voting referendums to determine the will of the Canadian people on specific issues before establishing new laws.- Cultivate and maintain outstanding relationships with the United States of America and the other G7 nations.- Introduce an obligatory one-year military conscription with a technical background degree for all eligible Canadian citizens (male and female) below the age of 20. - Establish a food-and beverage user tax on all questionable food choices such as fast-food items, sugary drinks, and high-cholesterol meals.- Implement harsher laws to protect women from rape culture in our society.- Protect the right and sanctity of life for the unborn and ensuring that abortion does not become a birth control option by setting up programs to provide women with pro-life choices such as adoption and/or government aid.- Increase the severity of punishment for major crime offenses including the option of capital punishment as a public deterrent. - Resolve the issue of Aboriginal self-determination versus a more comprehensive integration and assimilation of Aboriginals into mainstream society.- Build the necessary pipelines and mechanisms to safely transport our natural resources to domestic and foreign markets.- Protect the integrity of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian legal system by ensuring that foreign religious legal systems (such as Sharia Law) are never implemented anywhere in Canada.  As you can see, there are many social issues that need to be addressed. The Canadian Coalition of Concerned Citizens (CCCC) encourages everyone to join our mission and welcomes all productive comments and suggestions. We await your input and thank you for your active participation!"Please tell me why most of us on CPP disability live below the poverty line...it's not like I can go out and work ...and if I coukd I can only work till I make $5000......wow even then still way below the poverty line!!!"Yah I was one of the thousands who had to stand in the chilling cold waiting to get in, only to find out it was already full. So we waited for over an hour in -6 C while your organizers knew full well their was not enough room. They did not have the foresight or compassion to tell the people to go home in a timely manner."Canada and Mr. Trudeau are positive examples that the world should be looking towards and emmulating. Thank you for being a beacon of light in what has become dark times for the western world.Ok so you vacation on Aga Khan's private island.   Then give him 55 MILLION over 5 years for his development network.

I hope that you will be sentenced to the full extent of the law and then we can start to strengthen our great nation once again starting with Canadas' blessing of fossil fuels coal and gas business for generations upon generations to come!""This is fantastic. Remember the days when the con Harper shunned the press, cabinet and MPs weren't allowed to speak? Never again will we accept such cowards!"Please be sure to keep your promise on electoral reform.

Canadians are increasingly educating themselves and moving away from the Iron Age views of theism to the light of knowledge... let's represent this by accepting accountability for our land... with ""we""Keep our land!"We cannot totally phase out the oil sands. I am also not against the carbon tax but the rise of electricity costs is too much. Wynne's policy changes and taxes have undermined your federal platform. We need jobs right now not rising costs and taxes."Hello, Prime Minister J. Trudeau, Hoping all is well. I was just wondering / curious about something you spoke of during your Election Platform...it's in regards to raising the Amount of $Money currently being paid to our ""Old Age Pensioners"", do you remember speaking of this? We Do! It was part of your Platform package to get elected...and you did get elected! Can you please update me/us on where you are now with this motion, as it is very important to a large amount of Pensioners. Especially when it comes time to paying their Bills, with INCREASES on Utilities (Gas, water, Hydro) they aren't left with much to live on...go figure, most of these people worked hard for this country for many years and this is how they are expected to survive.I am starting with this message to you with hope of some feedback...but will raise the issue over and over if necessary.Sending this with all good intentions, hoping to hear from you soon!Best regards,Luigi L. Valvasori""For a guy who was born the son of a World leader and grew up among the very rich and powerful he's a refreshingly grounded person. Yes, there will be rich friends.

I really thought that you would be someone to challenge the status quo, as it turs out you are just another political weasel, like Father, like Son!!  You have spoken so many words yet have said nothing at all.... You are not a true Canadian, you are just another cash grabby moron that is living in a world of delusion..... You are just another political moron looking to build your own coiffures and retirement.... You have not the intellect to run this country, you are simply a political puppet with no indication of a spine!!  Any speech I have ever heard is nothing more than double speak..... In Your fathers words ""read my lips, no NEW TAXES!!""....  So the carbon tax will not have a trickle down effect?? Are you really that stupid!!! to think that companies will not pass their costs onto the consumers??? You are the most special kind of stupid!!! Next election, I am taking your job dipshit!!""When some Albertan talk about the story 'phase out oil sands',  but global oil market give no response, no news,  oil price stabilize, FK, looks like , canada oil has  o effect on global oil, even today , vernzlens oil cut will affect wti oil market,  my God, if the oil belong to canada. If Saudi say this word, oil will at least increase to 70$ within 2 minutes.compare with canada oil on output and reserve, only Saudi and Russia can match, USA shale, china Pryor, mean nothing."Thank You Mr Prime Minister.  You can be confident good Canadians recognize the positive effort You are contributing and support your Government. Smiles.Yeah went over like a rock in Alberta good luck... is it 4 years of you? Have your  wife work in the Oil Sands  and let me know how that goes. Also  you  accept minimum for  your job. Let me know how life is thenBaiting comment. I'm taking the bait. Break up a G7 country. A truly wild and cutting edge idea. Plan your referendum. Make sure the question is clear. Good luck. You said the West so you will need multiple referendums in different provinces with different questions unless western premiers all agree. Again good luck. Your new country will have about 12 million people and homes that cost 3 million in it's largest city.Justin Trudeau thanks for doing these town halls people are expressing their feelings and it's good to recognize and acknowledge them. the blame games can't foster 150 years of tradition and this could be done every year."I am very proud of you as my leader and being Canadian!  But as we see world wide there is much more needed from our Government today, than in the past. Seeing the results in the USA has made many people to look at politics very differently. We need a stronger  team of specialists. Governments should be required to hire the proven best professionals in each department  and not only one who has been a politician for ever. In the area of financial business perhaps the government should consider hiring a successfully proven money man like Kevin O'leary. In my opinion a money man is most often or never the right choice to fill shoes of our  country's leaders!!""Glen Gaffney10 hrs Œ‡went to a meeting of the save the benny forest core group at naughton heard different viewpoints, clyde mcnichol is very angry and has a right to be he is totally genuine. the big corporations want to do clear cutting in benny forest which will bring mercury to the surface, there is already dead fish in that area. pleasw we need your support and prayers. the group have facebook page""As if you don't have or make enough money for you and your family, you have to take free rides to your guru vacations.

Great job boss, keep up the good work."Douglas Winterburn that is a good stament.  The only thing missing is he has made the west hate the east. And the West do not like him at all. If he makes it  for another 4 years Alberta and  Saskatchewan most likely won't be apart of Canada."You are a true leader and I feel so blessed as a Canadian to know that you strive to serve us with humility, compassion and passion with the resiliency you command of yourself.  This is what our country needs and aspires to be . You are an incredible human being and I know and believe that Canadians and the world community shares the admiration. God Bless you, Justin.""Would love to meet you and discuss; health care, CRA ( worked there), minumum income, student loans, pension reform, a national WCB not Provinicial, sick benefits for EI should be a year not16 weeks (that could be a human rights issue) and many other things. I believe you are going in the right direction.""Mr Trudeau Canadian oil will never be phased out ! Actually you should working very hard to put Canadian oil on the spotlight because petroleum is the source of wealth of Canadíç oil is the biggest natural resource to keep our living standard, jobs, eduction etc too many benefits to mention!!! Governments come and go!! But Vamadian oil will never be phase out !!! It is one our best resources careful with your language!!""Today I will congradulate you on your courage in coming out into the real world and listening, looks like it hasnt been easy on you. I have a feeling that you are learning some facts that you may have been sheltered from before. Well siad below is that right now Canada looks great from the outside but not so good from the inside and its inside that is most important Justin. Good luck on the road and be safe. we will be watching to see what you do with all this reality you are seeing."Hearing or listening g cause the lady about the hydro bill you seemed not to listen but already had an excuse prepared before she even opened her mouth"Is this true?This makes me furious.""The suggestion is that the federal government may have to purchase äóìcostlyäó international carbon credits to meet the Canadian COP21 commitment.Think about that for a moment. In order for Western Canadaäó»s fossil fuel growth to be accommodated under our Paris commitments, the Canadian taxpayer will have to purchase carbon credits to make up the difference. In other words, weäó»re going to be subsidizing the energy industry again.The Trudeau government, with its we-can-grow-production-of-fossil-fuels-and-still-meet-Paris-COP21-commitments mantra, doesnäó»t want to admit to the relationship between increasing fossil fuel production and the need to purchase credits. And as long as the government doesnäó»t actually show anyone the numbers, it can pretend two mutually exclusive things äóî growing emissions and cutting emissions äóî can happen at the same time.Simply pricing carbon is not the magic bullet our PM seems to think it is.So letäó»s just accept that weäó»re all going to have to pay the fossil fuel industryäó»s Paris tab."""I guess Justin is trying to figure out what he's actually supposed to do as a Prime Minister.  It's more than photo ops and traveling the world like William and Kate."I really don't think you answer is going to answer any part of the question asked.You gave her the same smug response as you did when asked about your cash for access.Justin if you cannot handle PM then turn it over to someone who can.You need to do you job.""I am so thankful to have a leader who is willing to go out and speak to the everyday people.  Even with many disappointed Canadians.  He is going out to hear them, taking notes and will take all the information when he's done to make plans.  Plans to address the very concerns he's heard.  Thank you Justin Trudeau."Oil technology is improving to take care of our natural resources maybe you should look at Norway!! An oil rich economy!!

But the question is What are you gonna do about it?""try answering the question rather than blaming the Conservatives which every government has done once they get in power.  The pensioners disability Veterans should be the priority.  We haven't received a significant increase - $8 in year & a half is NOT acceptable with hydro food rent & & taxes for the ""poor' class.  People are becoming homeless because of this.  You are putting us in debt for all the wrong reasons & favouring refugees at the expense of CANADIANS!""You promised the people of Canada that you were going to legalize Marijuana once you got in?!Isn't it time that you stick to your promise and legalize it already?Please...""Justin Trudeau:  I simply can't wrap my head around how a Veteran isn't able to access what's needed.  We've a problem, don't we?  Veteran's Affairs Public Servants.  What is the issue?  Do they function, like our Compensation Systems do, Employment Insurance, CPP, as INSURANCE COMPANIES?  Where denial and exclusion is the goal of our VA?   Is that the problem?  Are budgets protected in order to free up money for the Executive and Management Public Servants as Incentive Bonuses they pay themselves?  Are Surpluses considered Profit, and out of that false-profit our Public Servants pad their own incomes, as was happening here in BC in our Compensation System, and across Government Service Systems under both Campbell and then Christy Clark's watch?  It seems these issues are mimicked service system to service system Federally and Provincially.  As such, it seems there is a systemic issue with ideology that needs to see the door, and perhaps some Public Servants along WITH that ideology?  I hear these same failings as an advocate and self-advocate on issues relative to disability due to PTSD acquired as a BC First Responder.  I hear this same story, far too much, from the Veterans who've served us, that when they come home, issues persistently act as barriers for our Veterans of both Public Safety and the Military.  If this is a systems issue, then these systems need to be called out, and we need to see any systemic issues fixed.  If they are systemic, the problems will stand out like sore-thumbs, as will the problem-children who may be generating these messes and barriers as well.  These issues obviously hasn't been to date under your mandate a priority.  Mental Health, Disability, Addictions, as well.  For if they were a priority, we'd see the same level of real action as we've seen on the economic issues, such as project approvals now dividing us here in BC.  Don't you think it's time such files be moved to the top of the pile?  We'd certainly appreciate that if they could.  Thank you.  I hope I'm heard.""Mr. Trudeau, just watching you on CBC news just now, you said it will be a challenge to do right by the middle class what about the POVERTY CLASS AND NON EXISTANT CLASS MR. TRUDEAU!  How about us that do not make more than $12,500 a year...what class is someone please tell me because that is WAY BELOW POVERTY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR US.... carbon tax wow such a great idea to grab more money from us that we don't have to exist on a daily basis fighting to get food on the table and gas in our tanks.....now you have a bunch of people you kindly brought in one year ago...what are they to do now........you cannot even take care of the Canadians that helped shape and make this country.....soon we will literally be left out in the cold..what is your response to that...probably none because you are schmooozing so many other people that are upset at you for the same thing....oh but of course take a vacation to a private island while we are all struggling to eat here in Canada.....pathetic really and why did we vote you in to make our lives what more difficult and upsetting thanks""Also, be prepared for the future, when a leader like you and other Prime Ministers will have interactions like Star Trek, Star Gate and Star Wars.Genesis 6 is your Bible verse to help you, since you're Christian like Pierre Trudeau.Best wishes.I love my Canada.""If Russia, China, Iran, N.Korea, attack us over Donald J. Trump, we need to be ready for war and be prepared for nuclear, biological and chemical war.This is something Canada must be ready for and clean up policy.""Turdhole you're an idiotic,incompetent,narcissistic moron. You have neither the skill or ability to run a lemonade stand let alone run our country!

You are not listening you are pivoting.  That is not good for Canada and it is not good for the elections that are closer by the day.  You were elected to stand apart from the normalities of Ottawa.  Your policies in place are supportive of the previous and you are suffocating those that help our economy."We're really struggling with the hydro bills. I don't think this is Trudeau's fault, I think he's genuine, but if there's anything he can do, I wish he would do it."Nice distraction! All talk and no action. Do you ever actually get any work done starting with creating jobs and fixing the economy?"Sorry to have miss this event. Hopefully he will be available in the near future.  P.M will slowly but surly will have achieve his goal.  Just give him time as Justin recognizes that he needs of working and middle class needs financial support by increasing CPP, and creating Jobs. Other wise we could have another TRUMP. God help us.""With due respect. I would like to bring it to your kind attention that Canadian community should proud such hard-working person like you, that is the great opportunity that you make yourself available in front of your people, as an afghan man let me tell you, I like your statement. and always I follow it, I like your emotional and feeling against refugees, I know, for them you gave new home and new live with your tear and lovely emotional, I would like to thank you on behalf of whole Afghan Canadian, which they living in your dream country, I love my country so much and I pray for his future to be like your country. Long live Afghanistan and Canada, and both people of the country."Time to stop blaming the previous government! you have been in office long enough to take responsibility for your governments actions!"We voted for you, please don't give the conservative watch dogs a reason to chastise you by using a private helicopter, watch your step Justin"You are totally disrespectful and incompetent to not attend the inauguration of Donald Trump - president of our most important ally and neighbour. You also embarrass all canadians. You should keep your love for Obama who was the worst president in US history out of consideration and do the right thing.

You do realise he is in a french town in quebec....I didn't see quebec people complain when he was speaking in just English in the other ProvincesIt is great to have a PM who can speak fluidly in both languages and can respond to the person asking the question in their own language.  I think that is fair to all.Je trouve que c'est un homme a l'í©coute de son peuple. Bravo mr Trudeau. Vous íÈtes aimí© de beaucoup de monde et je suis fiíÂre d'en faire partie.

I wish you were America's new president. Wishful thinkingYa don't have to watch it people always gotta find something to complain about idiots! The language is beautiful don't like it don't listen keep scrolling"Merci...ministre Trudeau...I hope that you'll be able to come to here in Owen Sound ,ON for a town hall meeting like this.  Owen Sound is the ONLY city in Georgian Bay...<3."My whole body just shivers when I hear your voice Trudeau. So frustrating that you are able to spend as reckless as you do.Not very happy with our PM. You should answer a question when asked in the language that it was asked. We are a bilingual society."Come on people, I am from Quebec and I am English speaking but I do speak French as well.  It is to everyone's benefit to have another language or two.""Je suis un Americain bilingue et je suis tríÂs content d'avoir l'opportunití© de í©couter et apprendre en Francais. Merci Monsieur le Premier Ministre, et merci aux Canadiens pour avoir í©lu cet homme.""When people ask you questions in English you should respect their choice of language and answer in English, YOU WILL BE REPLACED BY OLEARY SOON puppet"I was born in the USA.

Rien qu'íæ apprendre le franí_ais, comme la fille musulmane.""Canada _ôˆÂ_ôˆ_ is bilingual country and you haters will hate whether he spoke in French or English or alien languages, I myself speak a little French I can get the jest of what he saying!_ôÖŠ"Yes Canada is a officially bilingual and I am proud of that but when someone asks you a question  in the language they are comfortable with you should respond in that language. Period."White ppl need to have more babies, oh wait.. we're not trying to build armies with our children.. white ppl we are now the weakest link"Why are there so many bullies on here. Over who's English or French. Or what language is better. Guess I shouldn't be surprised.Que j'aimerais avoir un prí©sident aux EU comme Trudeau. Les Canadiens ont de la chance.

While I don't speak French, hopefully you're doing a good job in Sherbrooke tonight."He is explaining that Canada is bilingual but that doesn't mean Canadians need to speak both. It means you can receive government services in your preferred language."Our prime minister (UK) gave a live screened speech about Brexit today. The screen was FULL of angry emoticons. Here, the vast vast majority are positive. Much admiration for Canada and Mr Trudeau. _ôï_ô_"I just wish there was a translator made available during these Q and A sessions for both French and English. I truly enjoy these open sessions Mr. Justin Trudeau.Might as well be on holiday again Trudeau. 3/4 of Canadians can't understand French. Their Canadian schools didn't teach them French. Such a slow death for Trudeau.Very deceiving. I agree with Bob Jones and many others. Anglos have as many rights as francos in this province. Both liberal parties ( Canadian and Provincial) have gotten my last vote"Mr trudue, how can we survive with the kind of taxes liberals impose , when most jobs are minimum wages with no increase in pay""Il ne me semble pas convaincu.

It's not hard people. Just do it!"I think he had 3 previous townhalls - in English.  This is his 4th in a French town and in French.

Please consider to do this quickly. Thanks you for your co-operation.Kind of refreshing to see the icons flying by!! Last night it was a mixture of angry and sad - with some likes and hearts...Please improve Express Entry processing times Canada in Singapore. It's really unfair to take such a long processing time compared to the other Canada Visa Offices across the globe."Shame on you Trudeau for Not answering a question from an anglophone in English.  You have dissed all english speaking Canadians living in Quebec.   I for one, will Never vote for you again."Bravo d'íÈtre ici en Estrie. Welcome to the Eastern Townships- one of the most bilingual and open regions of the province."J'habite dans un pays qui a l'espagnol comme langue officielle et je peux comprendre quand il parle en anglais et franí_ais, English speakers you can learn French, living in a non French region isn't an excuse""Total disrespect Mr Trudeau, you should be responding to the person in the language the question was asked, whether it be in Quebec or any other Province in Canada..."So many people missing the issue.. the lady wants mental health services in her own (official) language and can't even get an answer in said language."We Canadian are proud of you do something for low income families.

Trudeau, vous  íÈtes un super Premier Ministre. Nous sommes chanceux le Canada.""While it's great that our PM speaks both official languages fluently, most of the rest of Canada doesn't. It would be more polite to answer questions in the language they were posed in"He (The Prime Minister) just explained why he's answering only in French (We are in Quebec) and needed more people to hear himToo bad he is approving the construction of oil pipelines that will carry super dirty oil sands material through indigenous landsWhy are some rudely complaining about him speaking in French? He is in Quebec. I can understand him just based upon my high school French. Canada is a bilingual country.  (I'm not even Canadian - maybe some day?)"when I was a kid, they came to me saying I didn't have to learn french as I am hearing impaired, and the fluency wouldn't be very good. I make no applogies""I wonder how many anglophones would complain if the PM spoke only in French in say....Toronto. Sounds stupid?

English, French, German, Arabic ... whatever! The important thing is to be a good prime minister""íæ celui qui a demandí© pourquoi il parle franí_ais: parce qu'il est au Qc, il l'a dit tantíÇt!""Hey, telling someone to get over it is unfair if they had translation that would be helpful. Nothing wrong with an inability to speak or write french""J'adore les í©lus qui sont proche et íæ l'í©coute de leur peuple. PM Justin Trudeau, un vrai leader qui aime sont peuple.

You said that you represent all the people of Quebec but you don't have the decency to address people in their own language - bilingualism I thought was a strength for us. Very disappointed.Vive le Quí©bec libreJustin Trudeau you need to talk to quebec health minister. No private clinics allowed to do ultrasounds. Kids being left waiting for them to rule out perhaps life altering illnesses. He's 6.5 years old by the way. This needs to be resolved urgently so private ultrasounds csn be done."The following ""positive"" comments regarding the Prim Minister are brought to you by The ""Liberal Propaganda Dept"" who have a miss claimer stating that some of the following comments ""just may not be 100 % True""!""I am just glad he is doing this,  it is hard work and draining but he hasn't bailed,  good on you Prime minister."Love you ä_Thank you Mr. Trudeau for your visit."Ce n'est pas la 1íÂre fois que j'í©coute ses interventions, Justin Trudeau est un exemple íæ suivre pour beaucoup d'autres Hommes de pouvoir dans le monde!

From this point on, please do not speak French in any other part of Canada, leave your French language at the Quebec border.  You are not being responsible by making up your fictions rules as you go!   You are showing our great country, just who represent.""Trudeau's double speak about indigenous affairs, legalized pot and pipelines created a high degree of mistrust by Canadians in any language.""I am very disappointed...very rude to the English attendees...apparently you are not the Prime Minister for all Canadians Je suis tríÂs dí©í_u ... tríÂs grossier envers les participants anglais ... apparemment, vous n'íÈtes pas le premier ministre pour tous les Canadiens"Make canada great againJUSTIN YOU SHOULD LEARN TO RESPECT THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE WE ALL LIVE IN CANADA WAKE UPJ'adore votre franí_ais mon premier ministíÂreHe refused to respond to a question in English from someone who asked about the eroding of English services. I guess he was afraid of the moles (language police) in the room. Canada is supposed to be bilingual and there was a huge Canadian flag in the room. Really? !?!"Merci Justin pour ton respect de rí©pondre en franí_ais míÈme sur les questions en anglais, car oui trop souvent au Quebec dans les entreprises dans un meeting, il y a un anglais sur 20 et le meeting apríÂs 5 minutes en franí_ais tourne íæ l'anglais pour le reste du meeting des deux ou trois prochaine heures.

You are just another example why so many hard working young Canadians are disillusioned with integrity deprived politicians and their personal agendas.  How about you, and all members of the Canadian government remember that you stand on the backs of this country's greatest asset, its middle class.  You were elected to represent the people, not tell them what is best for them."Offer trades programs to high school kids who want to get into it or that dont do well in traditional  school setting that would help  canadiens by giving them skills and we wouldn't need foreignersRemember when Harper held town halls in indigenous communities?... me neither...I have to say. The audience is absolutely beautiful. I love the diversity of Canada. äìë_ôëä_ and thank you Justin. You answered that question spot on. You are more impressive with everyday."Whoa, whoa, whoa...wait a minute- you sit and listen to the people of your country and then respond in an intelligent, considerate format???? I'm from South Carolina, USA, and to be honest, I despise the cold, but at this point ....please inform me as to how I can become a Canadian""This is just an observation.. But I've noticed the majority of comments on videos with Justin Trudeau are Americans, and the majority of comments on Trump related posts are Canadian. Here's my thought.. Perhaps if we all spent as much time dealing with our own issues instead of looking elsewhere for solutions, or something to hate on, we would all be much better off and more focused on what actually matters.""Mr. Prime Minister, you made a lot of very good points in your response to that question, but I honestly can't say that you actually answered the question."I love how he always seems to work on bunch of things ..for grearer cause unlike trump still not done anything goodWonderful but cut the cost. Post secondary education should be free to those who can prove they qualify. Not only indigenous people's but all Canadians.  My son is graduating from law school this year and he will spend the next ten years paying for it and I have spent the last ten years trying to help at great financial cost to me."I could cry seeing how awesome you are as a leader. Thank you for being such a great neighbor... appreciate your visit meeting our flawed elected #45-Robb in Delaware USA""You have a great vision for our country.  You handle yourself so well.  So proud of your first meeting with the U.S. president.  By the way, you did a great job answering questions yesterday in Parliament.""Speaking of flaws in the system. I'm switching gears here....How do you view your electoral promise of a ""new more generous child tax benefit"" as a success? I just received an reassessment today from Revenue Canada advising that I need to pay back almost $500 back of my child tax benefit because I didn't include it as income on on my return. We are a two income family with less than modest salaries and certainly don't have $500 to spare. This is money that has been deposited into my kids accounts for their education. In order for me to pay this back (by next week I might add), I am going to have to withdraw the money back out of my kids education savings accounts. When my kids ask me why, I will just have to explain that it seems our Prime Minister is a bit of an Indian Giver. Why is this money not taxed at the source???? I would rather receive less monthly or none at all rather than to be hit will a lump sum repayment that we can not afford. To say that you are offering a more generous child tax benefit is a farce. It may seem generous at first until the tax man comes knocking to take a modest portion of it back."Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau is simply a remarkable person.See the way he listened the question carefully then appreciated the person for asking such question. Over here in Pakistan the situation is completely changed.Hence nobody dare to ask any question or raise any voice against the govt. I wish we would be having such kind of team in Pakistan as well."Thank you, sir, for taking the time to complete this tour and talk with the people. Thank you also for your commitment to our Indigenous peoples. Please continue to be an example in word and deed.""""But here in Canada, your administration continues to follow in the footsteps of the former government. You are still hoping to build additional fossil-fuel pipelines.You continue to encourage dirty-oil production in the tarsands and hydraulic fracking.You support hydro megaprojects that massively ruin ecosystemsäóîand, in the process, stifle the development of renewable resources with much less environmental impact.And yet, today the bizarre truth is that few of these projects make good business sense without the hidden subsidy of environmental neglect.""""Indigenous people are disappointed with your pipeline plans and partnership with a voracious, power hungry mogul and his pals (who, by the way, think your name is Joe)""Maybe they should repeat the question to him and he should actually answer it instead of rambling on. They have been throwing money at them for years, plus monies they have been awarded through the courts. How is that working out.""Mr Primer Minister, you didn't answer the question. I didn't hear any answers from you about what will the federal government do to help educational programs for students and future teachers to be able to work in these communities to forward and provide more quality education...Spoken like a true politician...""I'm from Syria and refugees in Lebanon, how I wish to go, I and my family to your country of Canada in order to be aware of my kids better and their future better and Abaeidhm wars In order to live safely and stability of myself and I hope to consider before you in My wish my family and I Astkdama through UNHCR in Lebanon to your beautiful country of Canada, thank you very much""Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, have you considered the policy of annexing the United States? I think it would be very popular down here""My take away from his answer is that instead of only giving the Northern indigenous communities money, he would also like to see them govern themselves. Which is a win/win.""He can't even save Vancouver's real estate and he is going to save the country . The questionable foreign money  is entering Canada without any scrutiny and driving housing pricing up to millions in 2 major cities and the economy is down with no salary increase in many areas. He is busy pandering to look good in the media.I will not vote for him again!"The only way Justin Trudeau can help Canadians is to outlaw the liberal and conservative parties and then resign as prime minister!Thank you Justin for being real and always trying to connect to our Indigenous people and all  Canadians ! Keep up the great work you have my full support _ôï"Es usted, admirable un lí_der que tiene sus metas claras : ver por el beneficio de todos los canadienses en igualdad de condiciones y oportunidades, lo cual se logra con estudios acadí©micos, es la herencia míçs valiosa que podamos dejarle a las nuevas generaciones porque teniendo herramientas de estudio se puede uno abrir paso por la vida y míçs si es apoyado por un gran lí_der y polí_tico como lo es usted! Mis felicitaciones y admiracií_n total, Sr Justin Trudeau!"Please keep talking and then repeat it again in French!!  **sigh**  I really wish you led our country instead of Trumple-thin-skin.How about investigating Teranet for there part in land registry fraud committed by lawyers. Even Indian land has gone missing and being sold to foreign investors!Why do I not want to listen to him anymore? Perhaps because he stopped representing Canadians when he approved pipelines. He fell down when he did that. Leadership should be taken us into the future not back into the past. Oil is that past. Its our history not our future and he is only stalling the future by investing in the past. Time for oil domination to die a death fitting the damage it has done and will continue to do in the name of corporate profits. We need to invest now in future technologies and energy systems wind and solar and water and hydrogen. All viable if our leadership would just stand up and champion the cause instead of standing up for dirty Alberta tar sands crude that rquires 20 of the most toxic chemicals to be mixed with it so it will actually flow through a pipeline. Its those chemicals that represent the prime danger from a leak and a leak is guaranteed in a pipeline. Its the clean up thats impossible. They cannot clean up a spill. There is an 87% chance of a spill in BC if the pipelines go through. Can you live with that? I cant. Property values will plummet. Jobs will disappear. Economy will go down. Tourists will stop coming. Everybody from taxi drivers to restaurants and hotels will lose business big time along with all those who staff them. Are you ready BC? This is CHristy Promises for you. This is what Justin Promises for you. They will both collect tax revenue and you will carry the risk."The challenges will be overcome with hard work, constant awareness of needs; with each step forward , the needs will change, as our country and Indigenous communities  focus on the growing aspirations of the youth and the depth of their vision for the future. No magic wand! Canadians are inspired by Indigenous culture, as it   part of our daily lives in so many ways. Miigwetch to our Canadian government and the extraordinary patience and determination of our First Nations.""Good to see that Yellowknife gets a chance to vent, but BC gets ignored. Fitting that the tour ends with the 'Knife because that's what the Libs keep doing to BC."How lucky you guys are to have this sincere man that is so sensitive to join hands and never let anyone to feel left out..bravo ..great influence...A little puzzled as to who's question that was. Reading it from her cell phone indicates that it could even have come from the Prime Minister"Being the leader responsible for balancing the many and sometimes contradictory needs of our geographically and demographically diverse country must be overwhelming, yet our prime minster approaches the job with seemingly bottomless reserves of energy and dedication. I haven't seen anyone work harder at leading this country than M. Trudeau does."Love how much he beats around the bush. Not a single answer except the 2.6 billion he claims is going into their education but that's Canada-wide lol Cameron Cameron Herzberg"In this present time,where Mad and selfish Men seems to be running the World.You are indeed a symbol of hope.May God continue to bless you and your great Country.""From Tunisia, and as iam a fun of Canada and its Prime Minister Mr. Trudeau, i just want to say To this young man, thank you for your humanity, thank yopu for being so close to your people, thank you for your openminded way to reach progress and prosperity for Canaada.

Thank you for the love that you showed to all people there. God bless you, God bless Canada, God bless that sweet, kind and loving people""Thank you for normalizing the hated Donald Trump. Apparently Ivanka wants to bang you. And you just smiled all the way. Good luck to your people when Trump takes over your country along with your blessing, Tony Blair.""To have a question thrown upon...an extremely important reply was given.  To include and note that it is all the people of the land that makes up Canada, not just one group, one race or one section but all. To touch on the lows but outweigh with achievements.

Do try to stay true to your words given, keep a code of honor, be consistent in words and action and know, there are always many watching. An admirer""Instead of talking why dont you actually do something with results. These communities have people living without the bare necessities, safe water, hydro, walls, homes without mould. Do something physically. All politicians do is talk and leave the actual work to others without any support. Get your people get out there, forget your selfie and your photo opp and do something to help. Its 2017 for goodness sakes, no one in this country should be living like this. Safe homes, jobs, schooling...just do it. Stop travelling around wasting our money..."JT I love you...I truly do....but as a Nova Scotian teacher for the love of God....please please please please change the way elections are handled...do you see this got mess of a premier we have in Nova Scotia?!

There's real issues to take action on #GodblessCanada"Lets face it, Canadian government is doing nothing but taking away rights, land and yes even their lives.

Perhaps he cannot fulfill all your needs....Even God cannot. Justin Trudeau will try and loves all you Canadians and oppressed people. Be it know that he is a highly respected world leader, much loved by people all over the world. Look south at the traitor President who has sold the USA to the Russians to get into power.....all coming out in the news now. Your PM will NEVER EVER SELL HIS COUNTRY, he loves all of you and will do his best. Look at Putin, the murderous dictator, callously selling his people down the drain as he and his oligarchy enrich themselves and push aggressively, bombing and killing innocents. Look around you....do you want any of them to lead your country? Take your pick. Feel blessed that your beautiful country has a good leader. I think you Canadians are wonderful people, even the anti- Justin people seem almost cute compared to the Trump trolls and zombie apocalypse cabinet we have to put up with, as they turn my beautiful country into a fascist nightmare.""Nice bunch of Liberals you got around you.  You are such a devious fraud Justin Trudeau.  People want proportional representation, especially in remote places like the Yukon.  Stop the BS!""What language is he speaking.  I didn't understand a thing he said.Online college and university degrees are available across Canada now.  Degrees have never been more affordable or more accessible.""Speaking of broken education systems, is the Prime Minister actively watching Nova Scotia today? Because I believe the entire province has just given the Liberals a goodbye note, and Stephen McNeil would like to deliver it on his way out. ;-)""I'm not Canadian... yet... but wanted to Thank PM Trudeau for showing us, in America, what good governing looks and feels like.

When a human being makes a promise and keeps his/her promise, this demonstrates the integrity, trustworthiness and honesty of that human being. When a human being makes a promise and does not keep his/her promise, this reveals the treachery, deceitfulness and dishonesty of that human being.Right Honourable Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, during the 2015 Federal Elections Campaign throughout Canada and within the Official Electoral Platform of the Liberal Party of Canada, you decisively made the following promise to all Canadian citizens: äóìWe will make every vote count. We are committed to ensuring that 2015 will be the last federal election conducted under the first-past-the-post voting system.äóOn Wednesday the 1st of February 2017, within the House of Commons of Canada, the beacon of our treasured Canadian parliamentary democracy, you, Right Honourable Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, have shamelessly broken your signature campaign promise by blatantly discarding your long-expected electoral reform.Right Honourable Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, are you a human being of integrity, trustworthiness and honesty or are you a manipulative, treacherous, deceitful, opportunistic and dishonest liar who has won a so-called majority government with only 39% of my fellow Canadiansäó» votes? While awaiting your reply, I remain respectfully yours.""All of our nations need to address a widely ignored concern blocking equal access to education: Lack of adequate vision care. More children in Aboriginal communities struggle w/reading due to what are often basic needs not met. Not an alternate fact, a painful one.

Plus, I just like him.""Great leaders are honest people. Prime minister, you're a brave and wonderful leader. Wish to be have more people like you."Hi everyone. I am William from Syria . I live in Turkey everyday thousands of  refugees included education people and open minded people  stand in front of UN office to get chance to get in to Canada but unfortunately no one can get there easily except people who have dangerous illnesses .I hope one day to get there for making my dream come true ."American here. I may not agree with the PM's policies or political alignment but he is without a doubt the most down to earth head of state I can think of. He's not afraid to be seen interacting with the masses and that's something the US hasn't seen in years. So even though I am a devoted conversative, I have a ton of respect for the humility and feeling of normalcy that Trudeau gives off. God bless Canada and the United States. We in the US could not ask for better neighbors.""Boss after finishing your turn as pm for Canada, please come to Pakistan we will vote for you to be a pm of Pakistan just to teach our corrupt politicians how to make  corruption free politic and how to build  proud nation, spare us from all these white color criminals""Me encanta la manera de ver las cosas de nuestro ministro, a veces siento q el todo lo hace para darnos esperanza y eso es bueno."For every American political news story I try to read something about Trudeau's work in Canada.

Decrease regulations across the board.  The carbon tax enriches a few elite, via sales commissions and trade fees.  The few elite get richer, the rest of us pay more for our products.   The middle class stimulus program is a farce, unless you make it easier to do business, less tax and regulation.   Less red tape.   Small business people avoid hiring because the payroll expenses and regulations are to cumbersome.  It is actually better to not have employees.

Recently on CHOM you spoke of how you learnt politeness and respect from your dad at a very young age. Your example of addressing wait staff was impressive.

There is little competitor in the market. Only 3 to 5 companies dominate in the industry across various industries.

If you wanna speak English and want mental health services in English in a province that is historically French speaking than my advice to you is to move to another province. It's that simple. Expand your mind learn another language. Perhaps if you learned a second language your mind would be a lot healthier. If you want mental health services in English move to Alberta duh.

I'm an anglophone from Quebec and expect English spoken to me solely for convenience not entitlement, because I live in Montreal's West End where we are a sizeable majority. However, Sherbrooke is 98% French with an English minority of about 1.5%, meaning to accommodate the masses so they understood the question, Trudeau responded accordingly.

What recourse will Anglophones now have knowing that the highest official thinks that it is ok to not provide service in the language that it was requested in? I thought that a bilingual Canada meant that we can speak the langage we want, I guess it does not according to you, it means you have to speak French in Quebec and have to speak English in the English Provinces!

His refusal to respond in English to questions directed to him at a town hall meeting in Sherbrooke because ""we're in Quebec"" or responding, according to an article in the Ottawa Citizen, to a question posed in French at a town hall meeting in Peterborough in English, shows his utter lack of respect for his constituents and basic common sense. Canada is officially bilingual with both languages having ""equality of status"". One would expect the Prime Minister of Canada to set the example of what this really means. To bring petty politics into a tour meant to reconnect with Canadians across the country is ill-conceived and incomprehensible. These are teaching moments; as a former teacher, Mr. Trudeau has failed miserably."Darby DeJarnette translate for me lololWhy didn't they have a translator there?Why the angy facesBravo M.Trudeau_ôÖ_"Taux imposition 2016 : 42 390 $ ou moins	16 %Supí©rieur íæ 42 390 $, ne dí©passant pas 84 780 $	20 %Supí©rieur íæ 84 780 $, ne dí©passant pas 103 150 $	24 %Supí©rieur íæ 103 150 $	25,75 %.  pourquoi le taux change  par tranche ? .""I am very disappointed in you for refusing to answer questions in English when they were asked to you in English.

If you choose to translate or repeat in the answer in French or English for the benefit of the others in the room then that is fine.

Quebec is still part of Canada, ( after two failed referendums ) and in Canada there are two official languages, English and French. It takes a minimum of civility, politeness and respect to all Canadian citizens/residents to answer back in the language of their choice, the same language the question was posed. What is the point for Trudeau to fuel Quebec's language wars stoked by the Separatists willing to destroy Canada, language wars which have kept Quebec behind. The strength of a democracy is not about how it treats the majority but how it respects its minorities. By responding in French to an Anglo Quebecker's English question, Trudeau reinforced the discrimination the Anglo minority already suffers in Quebec . An Anglo quebecker is a Canadian citizen and deserves the same respect from the Prime Minister, whether he resides in Quebec or in Alberta."VIVE Justin Trudeau.!!!!!Police.ø_ø_™_øåø¬ø±øÂVenez en belgique on a besoin de quelqu un comme vousBravo M.

As an elected federal official, it's a prime minister's duty to address questions in the language they were asked. Provincial and territorial premiers have that duty, too, especially where numbers and communities warrant. I felt sorry for the woman who asked a question about mental health services and the language in which they were given. (This topic is of particular note to Quebec, where French is, of course, the majority language.) Prime Minister Trudeau could have answered the question in English and repeated the same information in French. Why didn't he do that? Remember, this is all about respect: If you ask a question in one language, it should be answered in the same language. Would anyone like it if someone answered your question in another language besides your own? Probably not. So yes, I'm all for respecting language and the like, but you need to respect the constituents above all. Prime Minister Trudeau, please take note. Thank you."Vive le Quí©bec libre ! ä_ì¥Ÿä_ì¥Ÿä_ì¥ŸVive le Quí©bec libre ! ä_ì¥Ÿä_ì¥Ÿä_ì¥ŸVive le Quí©bec libre ! ä_ì¥Ÿä_ì¥Ÿä_ì¥ŸVive le Quí©bec libre ! ä_ì¥Ÿä_ì¥Ÿä_ì¥ŸVive le Quí©bec libre ! ä_ì¥Ÿä_ì¥Ÿä_ì¥ŸVive le Quí©bec libre ! ä_ì¥Ÿä_ì¥Ÿä_ì¥ŸVive le Quí©bec libre ! ä_ì¥Ÿä_ì¥Ÿä_ì¥Ÿwhat immense control and manipulation for propaganda....SICK!!!Guaranteed living incomeAlexandre Beaulieu ton bro est chez vous™€™‹ ø_™‹ø_ø_øÈø±ø_™ƒ ™šø_™‹øÈ™‰ø¿™_ø±"I voted for you last election and support you as our prime minister for now, but your arrogant response to a question , asked in English, about mental health services for people speaking English in Quebec, where you threw the questioner under a bus by refusing to speak both official languages, is not acceptable behavior from our PM. Of all topics , this person was asking about mental health. Give her a break!! Give a bilingual response where warranted unless your intent is balkanization of your country. I understand that you did the reverse recently in Ontario, also unacceptable.

For all you people saying it is just fine that he only speak French , reasoning he is in Quebec and Quebec is a French province . For those of you that do not research before making comments, Sherbrooke is part of a region in Quebec called The Eastern Townships , Richmond , Magog, Melbourne,  Asbestos etc. anybody who is from that area knows what I am talking about. I myself am from Windsor which years ago was called Windsor Mills, Quebec, the Mills was dropped because it was too English sounding . The Eastern Townships was known for its English community and should still be , unfortunately a lot of the younger generation left the community I feel because they were feeling the pressure of the French language taking over , but many English speaking people are still there.  Therefore Mr. Prime Minister who is here for all Canadians , do your homework ,yes you are in Quebec , but were in a community where there is a lot of English speaking people born and raised there , I think it was insulting to them that you would not use both languages when you are in a area that is known for having both. I will say I am very disappointed in you , you say you stand for all Canadians , all this showed me is that you were disrespectful to the English speaking community in the townships .

I voted for for Justin Trudeau's liberals because I believed in him. A bilingual Prime Minister that would understand Quebec and it's linguistic issues. As an Anglophone who grew up in Quebec and was here when the Partie Quebecquois first came into power and who has watched the rights of Anglophone diminish over the years I was shocked at what transpired in Sherbrooke. Anglophones have learnt to be second class citizens on their own doorsteps. However to have the Prime Minister of Canada behave in such a disrespectful way is painful. What you have done is made it clear that even the Federal government does not believe that Anglophones in Quebec are equal to their Francophone counterparts and that we do do warrant to be served or dealt with in Canada's first language. Making French the primary language of the meeting was perfectly acceptable seeing as you were in Quebec. Even if you had answered the English question in French first and then English would have been acceptable. But I just can not believe the disrespect that you showed to ALL Anglophones in Quebec buy your choice to not speak any English at all, like we are second class citizens. The last time I checked Canada and the federal government still has 2 official languages and that all citizens of Canada can be served in the language of our choice by our Federal government. And the last time I checked, Quebecers are still Canadian citizens. This is a blemish on your record I my opinion and I hope you will see the error of your choice. There is always time to fix a wrong.I still have faith in you! Don't let us down."Www.swattextermination.ca montreal canada bed bugs thermal treatment montreal bedbug thermal Www.swattextermination.ca motel room hotels thermal treatment heat motel hotel room airplane building google Canada hotel multi-logements Www.swattextermination.ca traitement bedbug extermination heat"Where is the English translation, ...""Where is the English translation, ...""-You must practice the Christianity of the Jewish People.

I believe that if someone asks you a question in X language, be it anywhere in Canada you should answer in X language. I live this policy. Whether it is where you work, where you dine or at a bus line waiting in a queue, if someone comes up to you and asks a question in language X and you have the capacity to answer in language X, no matter how halting, courtesy demands that you respond in language X. You are the face of bilingualism and should be proud to use English in your home province, you had plenty of political capital that answering 1 or 2 questions from TAXPAYERS would not of caused a controversy.Mr. Trudeau, you are a rude, condescending, pandering, entitled, arrogant shame. You can expect my cut up Liberal membership card in the mail in the next few days and next election, if my health enables me, I will work just as hard as last election to get the NDP elected. Hopefully they have the sense after last night to reinstate Tom Mulcair as party leader."https://www.facebook.com/ronaambrose/videos/10154198863463525/https://www.facebook.com/jointherebel/posts/1259870097413260Linda MayersMilli Sakhttp://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/kevin-oleary-conservative-leadership-race-1.3939876Shekeba NazariNour Chamounhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1IawA37r9oBerkan Polatsi on estpas  capable de parler on va  fermerjaimerais ca  quil  me telephone   je vais lui donner  mon noquand va  tu tocuper  des  retraite quil on travailler  fortttttttttttttttttttttMulti-logements hotel room airplane building google Canada Montrí©al swatt Xtermination extermination montreal canada Www.swattextermination.ca swatt xtermination extermination montreal canada Www.swattextermination.ca swatt xtermination extermination montreal canada Www.swattextermination.ca swatt xtermination extermination montreal canada Www.swattextermination.ca punaise de lit Motels-HíÇtels-multilogements-condos google Canada hotel multi-logementsIt.

Bc you don't know what's happening here in Quebec.  If you only knew... did you know the Quebec government takes millions of dollars from tax payers to go around to sue things like THE WORD GRILL CHEESE I swear to god our government sued the word grill cheese. They sued a man for having an English website. All on our dime. They took our tax money to warn a sticker in a window. Why? Bc it's English so if you're not from Quebec I suggest you don't give your opinionsClaire de Bellefeuille you didn't go?!?"His father gave us a low dollar, excessive spending which ultimately gave us 18 percent interest rates and more taxes. Took 2 generations to fix - this Trudeau is even worse. He promotes bigotry, racism and hatred by giving to minority groups and taking away from the rest of us. Keeping us fighting against each other, while pretending to say we are all equal. Great examples, Take Lord's Prayer out of schools and puts Muslim prayer in schools. Schools are for learning English, French, social, science etc...it is not a church. He has added an environmental levy and carbon tax which applies to all except aboriginals. Hate to tell you, they heat there homes drive cars, buy groceries and emit as much as We do, even more for there businesses. They enjoy everything the 21st century has provided (free of all tax I might ad), I'm sure these luxury's were not in the treaty they signed. He has raised CPP (another thing that needs to be investigated), as well as EI, which has resulted in more people loosing jobs. Our dollar is tanking, our economy in the toilet, but let's bring in 300k more refugees ( don't care where they are from). But all Canadians are socially responsible (no we are not) brain washing. We will pay for them for many years, never mind the 100's of thousands struggling to make ends meet. But let's bring in another 300k this year. Getting to be automatically Canadians..this should not be! Making sure he gets his votes next time. While giving billions to foreign Countries, my god, look at the state of Canada. He has brought in a law that he owns your money. Any account over 100k will not be protected, it belongs to the government. The deficit he is running will take 4 generations to fix. I welcome another decade of 18 percent interest rates. Drama teacher needs to go to school and learn Economics 101. Just remember Harper lowered our GST by 2 points and balanced budget 4 times. This man is a disgrace, he should be in prison for treason. Hate to tell you, as a professional working in the field of Geology, the world has gone through many changes, it's natural and carbon is a natural gas that is created and helps the earth. You should look how the earth has changed over the thousands of years. We are not stopping this. . I guess all that's left to tax is air, since they already tax water. He has to go! But he will blame Trump and the conservatives when the time comes. But, don't I look good! Just remember it is the NDP and Liberals doing this, with the conservatives having to clean it up. Never forget it, as this will take generations to fix! For all you carbon tax supporters, I plead with you to watch this video of a geologist professor discussing carbon.https://www.facebook.com/FoSClimateEd/videos/995891600489689/?fallback=1"les retraiteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeMon.

Admittedly, P.E. Trudeau is a tough act to follow, but it requires more than self-confidence to improvise ; it requires the ability and the intelligence and the conviction that comes from actually possessing these qualities to respond to the moment.  In the beleagured Eastern Townships region, where the deeply rooted English population has experienced the steady erosion of its services and its centuries old society, the callous and opportunistic attempt to outperform the Conservtive leadership debate was juvenile and parochial.  So, this entitled, patronizing impression of your own creation of an initiate to Œ‚ the real world Œé of politics was of a young man who endeavored to exploit the inadequacy of his conservative opponents in the French language, only to lose the respect of a large and loyal constituency in the Townships.  In one self-agrandizing moment, Justin, you have confirmed the opinion of far too many that this is not about your country but yourself.  Disappointing that you squandered the moment to confirm your commitment to blilingualism and instead diminished an individual and a concept."https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6rmfM_gSgw parole paroleHow about some questions around healthcare and wait times in the Eastern townships. Or education and investment in our youth!"I was there this evening, I am a great fan of Justin Trudeau but I feel he could have acknowledged the large portion of Anglophones and he could have answered a couple to questions I both languages especially when the person asking the question clearly didn't speak French. He could have just said a few word of greeting in English as did the MP Bilodeau who introduced his.""Mr. Prime minister, i was very disappointed in your decision to answer an english question in french. English speaking citizens in quebec already face a great deal of discrimination regarding the language we choose to speak in. We hear a lot of ""on est a quebec parle en francais"" we really don't need our prime minister to validate that discrimination and support it. Last time i checked. We are in a great country called canada, where we are free to choose the language we want to speak in . And quebec in part of this great country.

Students, teachers and lawyers have been protesting the government's systematic dismantling of every viable institution in that part of the country. What has your government done to put pressure on president Biya who's been in power for 34 years to ensure his regime does not violate the basic human rights of protesters and call for the release of all the leaders of civil societies who were abducted at night and transferred to the the nation's capital?"A real human"By making middle class working citizens of Canada stronger economically which is the very backbone of the economy we would be ensuring a better economy for all Canadians. Most families are not even able to buy housing or to pay their mortages. We also need to take better care of the senior citizens who are living on pensions that do not cover enough for decent living conditions. Most money goes into target bracket which is the youth, university students which is fine because they will be the future. Somehow the budget needs to be balanced to take better care of all Canadians.

And was fortunate to get in after waiting over 3 hours outside with everyone else waiting. Unfortunately I wasn't able to ask my question. But I do give him the respect of going cross country to the people to answer their questions. My question, if given the chance. Why are there still very long delays in the EI system. I am the parent of a critically ill child with a rare disease. My daughter who is 16, suffers from a Mitochondrial condition called MELAS. First started at 10 but wasn't diagnosis till 11 when she was lying in a coma. Through out the years with many hospital stays. The wife and I have taken many days off work to be with her but at the same time one of us works to keep an income coming in. My daughter has suffered a few strokes  (5 with 3 being recurring) and it does take a toll on emotionally. Back to the question. I have applied for EI 3 times in the last 5 years so I can care for my daughter. The first time I was denied  . I appealed and won the favor of the umpires. The commission was going to appeal their decision but then suddenly change their minds. That ordeal lasted 3 months before I went back to work. The 2nd time I applied, there was no hassle. This time first I ineligible even with all the doctors and specialist notes about the decline of her condition. After a few calls and more doctor notes. I received a call stating that I was now approved but still had to wait 4 more weeks till it got to processing. When the time came, I called it was sent, and was told it could be another 4 to 6 weeks before I receive anything. By then I waited for more than 5 MONTHS! That would have been my question has to why parents with critically ill children  have to wait so long. Especially those with rare conditions.

A leader who can stand up to the bully that is Trump.I have never declared a political affiliation in my life. I do now, I have always been a proud Canadian, we are not perfect and have made mistakes as a nation.I do believe that with you at the helm we will be stronger than we ever were and after hearing your father speak and watching him stand up to the FLQ, the house of Parliament . and whoever he thought was wrong as a young teen.He was a man if great compassion and intellect he helped mend Canada's petty grievances between Quebec and English Canada which was not an easy task.I thought you may have been elected on name recognition but if that did play a role you have far exceeded my expectations. The mango does not fall far from the tree.You make our country proud. We may be going in a different direction Than many other countries in the world, even traditionally progressive countries.Canada stands for the good that is in people and the world.  It seems that it has fallen on Canada to take the lead in pushing progressive, inclusive of all, gender neutral, environmental and humanitarian policies.We are not alone in this on the world stage but we become more important everyday as our neighbour to the south sadly splits down the middle. You will be watched very closely as you negotiate with President Trump, there will be push back, nay sayers, trolls and supporters.  Count me in the latter group. Now I will leave the forum to some that agree and others that will take advantage of the anonymity of the internet to call me out for supporting my Prime Minister and my Country.What they, and by they I refer to both people that agree and disagree, do not understand, but I am quite sure you do. It is beyond their comprehension how little I care.Keep up the good work, repairing mistakes of the past, honoring those that gave all for our country, the immigrants that seek refuge here, and will help our country prosper, and most importantly the future for our children.As an Anglo Quebecois I wish my French was good enough to write this in French but it is not so I will not insult Canada's other official language by my incompetence.I wish you luck and you have my trust and support in a very difficult job."Canada"Justin Trudeau just came across Canada (by fossil fuels) saying we do not need oil!!!

Are UN agreements a legitimate barrier considering Canadians now have a constitutional right to use cannabis as medicine via the Allard decision?2) given that the plan is to tax recreational products on a sliding scale dependent on THC levels and the tax windfall is expected to be large, what do you plan to do with these tax revenues?I would like to see them put toward patient education and addiction programs as per your new focus on drugs as a social, not a justice issue.I think the task force recommendations are ok as a compromise, however, I still see a problem with them, which is that under a strict policy of control tax and regulate, there are still a number of barriers for patients:1) doctors as gatekeepers2) cost/pricing3) same old corporate control system that has been poisoning us since the beginning of the industrial revolution and prohibitionI believe prohibition was based on fraud - if it is not repealed, I and others believe there should be a royal commission into the reasons behind it, which are likely systemic corruption and vested interests. With a monopoly controlled market, price and therefore access will continue to be an issue, especially for legitimate patients such as children with epilepsy, for whom this is life saving.Now, you say that you are controlling it ""for the children"" but anyone playing with even a half deck of cards knows that's nothing but an illusion because you can't control these things. Kids access alcohol well before the age of 18 and it is ""tightly controlled"". People still produce moonshine despite it being illegal.You've had control via legal penalties since prohibition in the 20's and that hasn't stopped anyone. A controlled market does not benefit anyone other than the same corporate monopolies who have been benefiting from prohibition for decades. It will not stop the black market. In fact, the only thing that will stop the black market is to repeal prohibtion, remove cannabis entirely from the CDSA and allow the cannabis industry to self regulate. The oil industry produces a toxic product and causes great environmental hard, yet it is allowed to self-regulatePlease explain to me how cannabis - a non-toxic, medicinal substance that is a better alternative to alcohol, narcotics and many other things, including Tylenol - must be more strictly regulated than an extremely toxic substance such as oil?"Ly Nguyenhttp://yle.fi/uutiset/3-8889476 Your are super star Finland Justin Trudeau (y)http://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1013236/ecole-autochtone-saguenay-fermera-juin-tshiueten"Ples     see  for my family  im from iraq   but  now  we life  in beirut    0096170427847Ples  ples"_ôÍ´_ôÍ´_ôÍ´_ôÍ´_ôÍ´_ôÍ´Canada"I implore you to say NO to the pipelines,do not abase yourself to trump's level for 30 jobs,not worth it for anybody.Save Native Land water is sacred and so is land.Go with solar,wind more money to be made there.Thanks""Lol here's Valerie, trying to convince us that we need to be monolithic.

CHECK OUT WHAT IS HAPPENING. LIBERALS ESPECIALLY TRUDEAU IS TRYING TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE OF FAKE ISLAMOPHOBIA SO THAT GENUINE CONCERNS OF PEOPLE ARE ALSO TAKEN AWAY BY SLOWLY MAKING IT CRIMINAL FOR ANYBODY TO SPEAK AGAINST HIS FAVORITE RELIGION.PLEASE SIGN THIS PETITION IMMEDIATELY & SHARE IT WITH AS MANY PEOPLE YOU COULD.A BLATANT ATTACK ON FREE SPEECH, AND SO AN ASSAULT ON THE VERY CORNERSTONE OF OUR CANADIAN DEMOCRACY.THE PETITION: OUR LEGISLATORS MUST DENOUNCE ANY LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVE TO CURB OUR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH.**************************************************************************FROM REBEL MEDIA:Canada is on the verge of passing what amounts to Islamic blasphemy laws.PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAUäó»S GOVERNMENT IS QUICKLY PROCEEDING TO ADDRESS UNPROVEN INCREASES OF äóìISLAMOPHOBIAäóäóî AND HEäó»S GOING TO DO IT BY CURBING THE RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH.The governmentäó»s anti-Islamophobia initiative began in the form of a seemingly innocuous online petition presented to Canadaäó»s House of Commons. Citing no evidence whatsoever, the petition made a bold claim that Islamic terrorism has been used as a pretext for a ""notable rise of anti-Muslim sentiment in Canada"". The petition called upon the House of Commons to recognize that terrorists are not real Muslims by condemning all forms of Islamophobia, with no exact definition of what they meant by the term.That request äóî with no evidence, not a single case of Islamophobia cited, virtually no public input, and zero attention from the mainstream media äóî received unanimous consent by Canadian MPs.The petition was followed in rapid-fire fashion by a second motion sponsored by Liberal MP Iqra Khalid which called for the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage to produce findings and recommendations within 240 calendar days of the motionäó»s acceptance. Titled äóìSystemic Racism and Religious Discrimination,äó the Motion M 103 demands that the government not only condemn Islamophobia in word but that it also develops a whole-of-government approach to reducing or eliminating Islamophobia.And so, itäó»s anticipated that legislative remedies äóî legal options äóî will be front and centre in the Committeeäó»s efforts going forward.In short: THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT IS PREPARING TO SILENCE ANYONE WHO CRITICIZES ISLAM.THEIR ANTI-ISLAMOPHOBIA MOTION (WHICH WILL, IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, BE VOTED ON DURING THIS PARLIAMENTARY SESSION) RESEMBLES A KIND OF BLASPHEMY LAW IN FAVOUR OF ONE PREFERRED RELIGION ABOVE ALL OTHERS. IF THIS MOTION PASSES, IF THIS MOTION PASSES, CANADIANS CAN BE PERSECUTED FOR EXPRESSING ANY CRITICISM OF ISLAM, EVEN WHEN WARRANTED.This unfounded anti-Islamophobia legislation flies in the face of our Constitution and its embedded Charter of Rights and Freedoms.Sharia law and itäó»s related speech codes are not a reasonable limit on my freedoms.According to our charter of rights and freedoms äóî weäó»re all equal.

The little potatoe should step down"With such large scale organized crime going on for over half century, humans tortured 24/7, everything else is merely a political show!This happens in Vancouver and Edmonton. For you and your family's wellbeing and safety, you need know about it, so you don't damage or push each other to disasters when it happens to you or someone around you.Are you helping with a new hidden community based organized high tech crime without acknowledgement?It's an extreme crime against humanity covered for over half century by now, I'm posting this with the perpetrators in the unit above shooting pulsed electromagnetic beams at me causing severe pain and burns.Organized Gang/Group stalking is the first stage of this organized crime. It starts from a severe defamation to the victim of 'being dangerous' or 'being mental' by some security professionals and/or medical professionals. The purpose of this stage is to track down all the social connections of the victim and to destroy all, to completely isolate and discredit the victim, to break down the nerves ideally to drive the victim to insane, so that there is no possibility left for the victim to leak any information of what is being done on them by this torture-to-murder program, or even they do nobody will believe them; so that there is no way for the victim to get any help or find any way to make a living. All this is to prepare the victim for further torture and eventually force the victim into suicide or other forms of 'accidental' or sick or sudden death, without getting any attention from anybody or any society, therefore the criminals can get away with legal accusation of first degree murder and extreme crime against humanity.Electromagnetic weapon torture-to-kill is the second stage of this extreme crime, with the stalking goes on to make sure the crime is done secretly and safely. After certain time of the en masse stalking, the victims are put into an invisible jail walled by hundreds to thousands of stalkers. The victims have completely lost all the contacts, lost freedom, some weaker ones are over stressed and driven insane. The electronic torture and murder starts, along with some bio/poison drugs. The victim is completely turned into a target of electromagnetic weaponry and bio/poison drugs. The perpetuators surround the victim 24/7 wherever he/her goes, equipped inside and around the victim's living quarter with electromagnetic weaponry, shooting the electronic beam from under test ELF (extreme low frequency)/EHF (extreme high frequency)/LASER/MASER microwaves weaponry, which will cause non stop pain in anywhere it hits, cause leukemia, cancer or sudden organ failure over the time. The weaponry they are using on these victims are already classified as Less Lethal in Europe because although it doesn't cause death instantly but will over the time. But in North America, these weapon are kept top classified secret, and in order to make it possible to test, they are called very forgivingly 'non-lethal weapon', which is a big lie.Starting from a defamation is to fool and maneuver the mass public to get involved in the en masse stalking because to put a 24/7 surveillance onto someone wherever and whenever, they need help from the community and public.The project is carried on by local and/or foreign security and medical professionals, for example but not limited to, security companies, retired agencies or private firms, who had/has the chance to be exposed to secret classified technologies and now utilizing it to form a long term murder scheme and network for profit, the ill will behind this and the ultimate goal of it have no difference from any other murder except the technologies are unknown and unreachable to the public. All the perpetuators are on a central dispatch system which is done through their cellphones so the hidden faces know every second where the victim is, which direction he/she is heading to, what the victim is doing and with whom, so they can plant their guys and weapons. Some are called sleeping cells. They maybe shopping with wifes or kids in that area before they got orders to watch or follow someone, or get ready their weapon to harm the target.Many victims are forced to insane or suicide before being able to figure out what's going on to their life. These victims are normal citizens just like you and me, not politically or religiously involved in any thing. And once one is flagged as a target of this kind of group stalking, there is no end of it until the victim is cornered or tortured to death.Fooling and maneuvering common mass citizens into this stalking crime is the dirtiest part. Shame on Vancouver, Edmonton and Canadian government"How can you be online and not be informed?
